## Briefly, What is Voice of the Customer?

Unlike [Net Promoter]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}), VoC isn’t one
“thing”, with one “inventor”, and a single, unchangeable definition.

It’s a term which has evolved over time, starting in the late 1960s.

Pioneers like [Yoji Akao](https://asq.org/about-asq/honorary-members/akao)
and [W. Edwards Deming](https://deming.org/deming-the-man/) were responsible for
systems, mainly in manufacturing, which aimed to produce
the best-possible products by deeply understanding customer needs.

![Timeline of Voice of the Customer methodologies from 1960 to 2010](/assets/img/guides/what-is-voc/voc-timeline.webp){:class="img-fluid"}

These systems were a huge factor in producing businesses that can build the
consumer products we enjoy today. But although they definitely incorporated
‘the voice of the customer’, they didn’t really address **customer service** or
**customer experience**, as we understand those terms in the 2020’s.

This was largely because back in the ‘60s, manufacturing was a much larger
part of the economy. But [gradual changes, accelerating rapidly from the 1980s](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29) have shifted the
economy gradually towards the ‘services’ sector, with a commensurate need
to use VoC to measure and improve the quality of these services.

So, the 80s saw attempts to use **Voice of the Customer** to improve service
quality. An early model, still used today, was Parasuraman’s [SERVQUAL](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/servqual/)
model, but the most fundamental shift arrived in 2003 when
Fred Reichheld introduced [Net Promoter]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}).


### Net Promoter: The template for ‘modern’ VOC.

A lot gets written about NPS (we’re as guilty as anyone), but a lot of it
misses the point (hopefully we’re not _as_ guilty of this).

You can debate endlessly how to [calculate NPS]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %}),
what [benchmarks]({% link _researching/nps-benchmarks.md %}) to use, what the
perfect [NPS Survey]({% link _researching/nps-surveys.md %}) looks like, but none
of those things will materially improve customer experience, and thus, revenue.


The designers of NPS are pretty clear: **To improve customer satisfaction,
NPS requires a ‘[closed inner loop](https://www.bain.com/insights/the-net-promoter-systems-inner-loop/)’**.

Otherwise, it’s just sending surveys and hoping for the best.

![The NPS Closed loop](/assets/img/guides/nps/nps-closed-loop.png)

This closed loop is the mark of a modern VoC system that improves your bottom line.

* **The ‘Inner Loop’** ensures that individual customers have their voices heard:
  Any problems they have with services or products get a timely resolution.
* **The ‘Outer Loop’** ensures the collective ‘voice’ of all customers is used
  to consistently improve the entire business over time.

Modern, best-in-class, Voice of the Customer
improves customer experience in the short-term **and** long-term.


## Benefits of Voice of the Customer

We’ve already established that VoC — especially in its research-focused forms —
improves the products and services a company produces in the long-term: better
cars, nicer phones, new airline routes and so on.

But what are the [benefits of modern VoC]({% link _researching/why-customer-feedback-is-important.md %})
that ensures customers are happy at every touchpoint?


The article linked above goes into a lot of depth about nine benefits
of VoC, but if we were to summarise the top 5:

1. **More repeat customers**: This hopefully goes without saying. Fix problems
   quickly, and customers are more likely to come back because they trust that
   even if things go wrong at first, they will end up going right.
2. **More new customers**: Making customers happier boosts your reputation through
   word-of-mouth. A better reputation means more people forming a queue to buy from you.
3. **Lower churn**: Not all churn is inevitable. A lot of attrition can be averted
  by simply finding customer issues and fixing them before they start talking to your competitors.
4. **Easier up-sell and cross-sell**: proactively listening to customer needs opens
  up conversations which wouldn’t otherwise occur. These conversations are
  an opportunity to discover new needs, and introduce customers to your offerings which
  meet these needs.
5. **A happier [team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %})**: A _real_ VoC
  programme which shares feedback with your team improves performance and morale, which
  in turn — surprise! — improves customer service.

## Voice of the Customer Case Studies

If you’re wondering about how getting VoC right would benefit you, just
[get in touch]({% link contact/index.html %}). We won’t hit you with a sales pitch, we’ll use
our maturity model to assess what you’re currently doing and give you some
suggestions to level up.

Here’s some teams we’ve worked with to improve their bottom line through VoC:

### VoC Case Study 1: [Covéa Insurance]({% link _case_studies/covea.md %})

![Covea office photo](/assets/img/case-studies/covea/office2.webp){:class='longform-pull-left'}{:style='width: 20%'}
Covéa, a large, UK-based insurance firm has a long track record of caring
deeply about their customers. However, they sensed that a more
immediate and engaging Voice of the Customer process was possible.

CustomerSure worked with the Covéa team to modernise their VoC programme,
resulting in them gaining a far broader and deeper insight into their business.

With an agile platform, and a culture shift towards customer feedback being
part of ‘business as usual’, the Covéa team have been able to rapidly investigate
multiple touchpoints, collect feedback, and improve their business more rapidly.

### VoC Case Study 2: [Barchester Healthcare]({% link _case_studies/barchester.md %})
![Barchester Care Home](/assets/img/guides/barch-case-study.webp){:class='longform-pull-right'}{:style='width: 30%'}
As a a premium care provider, it’s absolutely imperative that Barchester
put quality at the forefront of everything they do. But it’s not easy to manage
the diverse views of both home residents and their family and friends, across
over 250 care homes nationwide, across a range of different business functions:
From food and beverages, to the activities offered to residents.

Barchester worked with CustomerSure to build a robust Voice of the Customer
programme, capable of making customer feedback available to the right people at
the right time to take action to directly improve resident satisfaction.

The result? **Three years of consistent NPS improvement**.


### VoC Case Study 3: [GBG]({% link _case_studies/gbg.md %})
![Barchester Care Home](/assets/img/guides/gbg-case-study.webp){:class='longform-pull-left'}{:style='width: 30%'}

GBG are the global specialists in identity intelligence. They offer a suite of
products around identity verification and fraud prevention to a variety of industries.

Working with CustomerSure, the GBG team streamlined their global VoC programme,
ensuring every customer is able to leave feedback, and crucially, this feedback
can be escalated quickly to a complaints system if needed.

Because feedback is part of ‘business as usual’, satisfaction remains high,
customer comments are used to improve GBG’s products and services, and GBG have
became sophisticated enough with VoC to publish a
‘[you said, we did](https://www.gbgplc.com/en/contact/customer-support-enquiry/you-said-we-did/)’
page, demonstrating to current and future customers that they take customer
experience seriously.



## [Voice of the Customer Best Practices]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %})


When we help a firm to put a VoC programme in place, the  steps we
take will depend on their current level of VoC maturity and
their business goals.

But we’re always guided by these three principles:

1. **Get feedback at the best time**: Before setting up your VoC programme, make sure you
   have a clear picture of your customer journeys and their touchpoints. Review —
   from the customer’s point of view — when they would like to give you feedback.
2. **Make it easy**: Once you’re asking at a convenient time, make sure you’re
   asking in a convenient way. Use the customer’s preferred channel, make
   sure the [VoC questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
   you ask match customer goals rather than business goals. And don’t use
   design patterns that upset users, like [multi-page surveys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8190652/).
3. **Act on the feedback**: The case for acting on the feedback your Voice of
   the Customer surveys collect is both moral and financial. It shouldn’t need
   repeating in 2024, but asking people what they think and
   ignoring them falls below the baseline experience that people expect.

   And, if you ask-and-ignore, don’t be shocked if your customers reply-and-switch-to-a-competitor.
   It’s better to have not asked at all, rather than to raise hopes to disappoint them.

These three rules are our way of structuring the foundation of any
successful VoC programme: **design it around the customer**, and business benefit
will naturally follow.



## How to build a VoC programme

There’s a catch-22 at the heart of every VoC project.

![Goodhart’ Law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure]({% link /assets/img/guides/goodharts-law.png %})

To **achive business goals** (the increased revenue we discussed earlier), the
programme needs to be **designed around customer goals, not business goals**.

The moment you start placing the business’ needs over customer needs, i.e.
‘what can we do to maximise [response rate]({% link _implementing/survey-response-rates.md %})?’
or ‘how do we [improve NPS]({% link _implementing/improving-nps.md %}) from 60 to 70?’,
Goodhart’s Law is likely to kick in, and you’re likely to optimise to hit these
targets (higher response rate, higher NPS)…

But these targets don’t ‘magically’ lead to a healthier bottom line.

You win the financial benefits by making customers **genuinely** happier. Feel
free to **measure** response rate, NPS, CSAT, or anything else… But **target**
an improved bottom line.

In practice, you need to move through the following steps:

### Stakeholder Engagement

Businesses who succeed with VoC
are customer-centric from the top down. Ask a senior leader to choose between
cost-saving and customer-pleasing, and they’ll choose the latter.

Before you embark on your VoC project, you should ensure that senior leadership
are completely bought-in to your objectives. If the project is seen as a
‘nice to have’ rather than a foundation of your customer experience strategy,
it doesn’t stand much chance of success.

Everyone involved in the project must agree on the project’s goals, how they’ll
be measured, and what success will look like.

_([Here’s a guide to putting a VoC business plan together]({% post_url 2024-03-19-customer-experience-business-plan %}))._

### Roles and Responsibilities

Once the goals are defined, based on a shared understanding of ‘success’,
you need to work out how to achieve these goals.

Who is responsible for immediate follow-up? Who has authority and budget
to make sure that the business makes the long-term, structural improvements
that customers will ask for? How will the board be updated on progress and results?

### Pilot
Pick one touchpoint, and start gathering customer feedback. Ensure that that
the processes you’ve put in place are actually working. Tweak anything that
isn’t quite right.

Once you’re happy that for this one customer touchpoint, dealing with feedback
is just part of ‘business as usual’, it’s time to…

### Roll-out and Review

Gradually expand the number of touchpoints that your VoC programme is covering,
until customers have the opportunity to give you feedback on every **meaningful**
interaction.

Periodically review the project, to ensure it’s still achieving what it set out
to achieve. You’ll need to carry out both strategic reviews to assess whether
the programme is still meeting its goals; and tactical reviews: are you still
asking the right questions, over the right channels, at the right time
to hit those goals?
