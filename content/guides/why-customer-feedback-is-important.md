Most of us like to think we understand why customer feedback is important for business. But if pressed, we often find it challenging to explain exactly how feedback helps a company grow. That’s where [we](/) come in.

## The difference between Customer Feedback and Market Research

Before we dive into our top 10 customer feedback benefits, let’s clear a common misconception up. We often hear people talking about “the benefits of customer feedback,” but what they mean is the
[benefits of market research](https://happy-creative.co.uk/5-benefits-of-market-research/).

Research is great, but don’t fall into the trap of calling it feedback.

**Feedback** is giving all your customers a chance to tell you what you
need to do to keep their business – and dealing with the individual responses.

**Research** is asking lots of questions of some of your customers and
**reporting** on the results (for example to influence strategy or inform new
product developments).

When we see bad customer surveys, it tends to be because someone with good
intentions is
[mixing up market research and customer feedback]({% post_url 2018-04-25-market-research-vs-satisfaction-surveys %}).

So, now that’s covered, let’s get stuck into exactly why customer feedback is important for your business…

## 1. More repeat business

Customers have a choice where they spend their money. You want them to welcome your offers and promotions, not ignore them.

Understanding why customer feedback is important helps ensure your customers are happy, so your marketing efforts don’t fall on deaf ears.

Don’t rely solely on an annual survey to gauge overall happiness. Make sure you check if each customer is willing to buy from you again. If that sounds costly, compare it to how much you spend in sales and marketing to win a new customer!


## 2. More new business

Word of mouth recommendations grow your business, and cost nothing.

But, a customer needs to trust you won’t damage their reputation by giving bad service after they recommend you. This is where the benefits of customer feedback really come into play. By collecting and, more importantly, acting on feedback, you can ensure everyone is 100% happy and more likely to recommend you when given the chance.



## 3. No More Lost Business

You can ask customers how things are going face-to-face, and they’ll say ‘fine’,
even if that’s not what they’re thinking.

Small niggles can build up over time and make customers more receptive to a
pitch from a competitor – it’s better to make the grass always greener on
_your_ side by making it clear you always welcome candid feedback.

Encouraging honest feedback not only helps you address minor issues before they become major problems, but it also shows your customers that you value their opinions. This approach will strengthen loyalty by showing you are dedicated to continuous improvement, and are not afraid to hold your hands up when something goes wrong.



## 4. Easier Outbound Sales

Customer feedback benefits go way beyond just making improvements. When you truly understand why customer feedback is important, you can turn those insights into case studies and testimonials - these are the oxygen that your business development teams need to thrive.

When you collect feedback, you have a brilliant source of raw material for your case studies. Depending on how your business runs, you might be able to use unfiltered feedback on your website as reviews (after getting explicit consent from your customers to do so, of course), or you could just use feedback to identify your “super fans”, and pass them to your marketing team as leads to follow up for case studies.

These real stories build trust with new customers and show off your business's value. Plus, they give your marketing a huge boost and help attract even more customers.



## 5. Win in competitive bids

If your business submits competitive bids and tenders for work, feedback has two
huge benefits

First, it’s great to have a body of evidence from your current customers that
you’re great to deal with. From working with our customers, we know that most
feedback you’ll collect is overwhelmingly positive, so it doesn’t hurt to add a
sample to any competitive bid.

But more subtly – when you collect feedback, you have all of your current
customers, in their own words, saying what’s important about your business to
them.

Don’t underestimate the benefits of customer feedback. When your happy customers talk about what they love about your business, it hits home with new clients. This will be very similar to what’s important to the prospective customer you’re bidding to – and expressed in a language they’re familiar with, making your bid stand out even more.



## 6. Stronger reputation

We’ve already touched upon why acting on feedback ensures that
customer-by-customer, people are happy to come back, spend more, and refer their
friends.

But what’s harder to quantify, and equally important, is the <em>cumulative</em>
effects of all this goodwill.

When lots of customers are fans of your brand, unexpected things happen. The
whole is greater than the sum of its parts. When many people are aware of you,
and have a ‘good feeling’ about your brand, unexpected business opportunities
start appearing more often… And your [team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %})
start feeling better about where they work.



## 7. Cross-sell & up-sell opportunities.

The best time to try selling something new is when customers are happy with you.

Recognising the benefits of customer feedback and having an open dialogue with your network allows you to not only hear any issues customers have, but also resolve them. If you’re going the extra mile for your clients, yes, they will be happy, but you’ve also created a solid ground for trust, making them more likely to consider cross-sell and up-sell opportunities you present to them.




## 8. Morale and motivation.

Getting praise and [sharing customer feedback with your team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %}) can give your staff a real boost. It gives them confidence that business is on the right track, they're doing a great job, and peace of mind that another customer account is secure.


Every time a customer gives praise, someone in your business feels like a hero. This is one of the great benefits of customer feedback. It not only pumps up your team, but also builds a culture where everyone wants to keep getting better. When employees see how their hard work makes customers happy, they stay more engaged and motivated, which can take your business to the next level. It’s a win-win, both internally and externally.



## 9. Improved skills

Receiving verbatim comments from customers means there’s nowhere to hide. All
the training courses in the world are no substitute for lessons learned through
personal experience.

A tough comment can feel raw, but as long as you learn from it and put things
right, you’ll never make the same mistake twice. And it’s easier for the
feedback to come from a customer than a colleague, because the person receiving
the feedback knows there’s no agenda.


## 10. Really Get to Know Your Customers
One of the biggest benefits of customer feedback is that it helps you truly understand your customers. By using feedback surveys, you get to dive deep into what your clients think, feel, and want. It's like having a backstage pass to their thoughts!

When you know your customers inside and out, you can tailor your products, services, and marketing efforts to fit them perfectly. This not only makes your customers feel valued, but also boosts your business. You don’t have to guess what your market might want or react well to, you already know - because you’ve done the background work.
So, don’t just guess what your customers want—ask them! Understanding why customer feedback is important and actively seeking it out can give you the insights you need to stay ahead of the competition and keep your customers coming back for more.


### Benchmarking isn’t a benefit

If you think
[benchmarking against your competitors]({% link _improving/benchmarking-customer-satisfaction.md %})
is a benefit of customer feedback, then think again.

We know that you’re curious about how the competition are doing. But finding out
isn’t going to make you more profitable. What does it matter if you’ve got an
NPS score of 20, and your competitor has a score of 50? It’s the direction of
travel that’s important. A NPS of 20, up 5 points from last quarter is a much
better indicator of future success than a score of 50 which is dropping like a
rock.

> If benchmarking is your objective, you’ll pretty quickly find yourself breaking
> the [golden rule]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %}) of making your
> feedback process 100% customer-centric. The project will become more of a
> research exercise than a genuine effort to make things better for your
> customers.

This might bit sound like the worst thing in the world, but **it’s the golden
rule that lets you reap the ten benefits above**. It’s not important to
“collect feedback”, it’s important to have a customer feedback process that your
customers love.

So you can sacrifice all these benefits in pursuit of benchmarks… Or you could
experiment with not pursuing satisfaction benchmarks, and seeing if your
organisation ends up better for it. We’ve worked with hundreds of teams who’ve
let go of benchmarking, and we don’t know of one who would trade their delighted
customers for the "gossip" of knowing how they’re doing against their
competitors.
