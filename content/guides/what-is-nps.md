Net Promoter’s blessing, and its curse, is its simplicity.

It’s a simple idea to explain, but getting it right in practice takes attention
to detail.

Imagine kicking a ball. It’s simple to visualise, and it’s easy to explain to
someone who’s never kicked a ball before. But to do it well takes a bit more
finessing – how much power you strike with, which surface of your foot you use,
the direction of your leg; they all affect where the ball ends up. Experience
matters.

And so it is with NPS. It’s a simple concept, but your success depends very much
on your attention to the details.

These guides are perfect for anyone running customer contact teams who wants to
start, or improve an existing Net Promoter project. We’ll show you how to you
get measurable results.

This section explains the basics: What NPS is (clue: it’s not a question, and
it’s not just a score) and where it comes from.


## What does NPS Stand for?

**NPS** helpfully stands for two related but different things:

* Net Promoter **Score**, a way of tracking customer loyalty, which we’ll
[teach you to calculate]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})
* Net Promoter **System**, a set of processes you put in place to make sure this
score leads to an increase in customer loyalty, and thus profitability.

The score is simple – it’s just a tiny bit of arithmetic on the answers to the
**Net Promoter Question**.

But without the *system*, the *score* isn’t much use. It’s just a number. So,
we’ll focus on the **Net Promoter System**, because it’s implementing the system
as a whole which will deliver results.


## What is the NPS Question?

There’s a short and long answer. In brief, the Net Promoter Question is:

“What is the likelihood that you would recommend _company x_ to a friend or
“colleague?”

![The Net Promoter Question: What is the likelihood that you would recommend Company X to a friend or colleague?](/assets/img/guides/nps/nps-question.png){:class='img-fluid'}

It’s also called (obviously) the ‘recommend question’ and (less obviously) the
‘ultimate question’, because of the title of the
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Question-Revised-Expanded-Customer-Driven/dp/1422173356)
which first popularised Net Promoter.

But as we said, neither the **question** nor the **score** alone will improve
your business.

_Measuring_ loyalty doesn’t improve it.
[Benchmarking]({% link _researching/nps-benchmarks.md %}) loyalty against your
competitors doesn’t
improve it. You need to _act_ to improve loyalty, and that’s what the Net
Promoter **System** helps you do.

It’s a good system, because at its core it incorporates the two acts that
actually make a difference to loyalty:

1. Listening to your customers
2. Doing what they ask of you

CustomerSure helps you get better at listening to your customers:
It’s the right thing to do, and it’s the best way to grow a business. As such, we like Net Promoter:
It’s a simple, well-understood system that helps you listen and act on what you hear.

Some people don’t like either the question, the score, or both, and that’s fine.

This guide probably won’t change their minds.

But the most important parts of the Net Promoter **System**: listening to your
customers and fixing things should be essential to __any__ project which tries
to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. These are so important, we consider
them the [golden rules of customer feedback]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %}).

## What’s the history of Net Promoter?

Before we go forward and look at the Net Promoter System, let’s quickly go
backwards and look at where it came from. If you’re serious about implementing
NPS, it’s good to know why this question is the "ultimate question" – it wasn’t
just plucked out of thin air.

### Why the NPS Question?

In 2003, a consultant at [Bain & Co.](http://www.bain.com/) named Fred Reichheld
started researching which customer satisfaction question was most strongly
linked with growth.

His team compiled 14 case studies, where they compared responses to ‘customer
satisfaction’ questions to actual, measured customer behaviour. The questions
they tried were all derived from Reichheld’s earlier
[loyalty acid test](http://www.loyaltyrules.com/loyaltyrules/acid_test_customer.html).

In 11 of these case studies (**78%**), the NPS question was the most powerful at
predicting future customer behaviour. In two of the remaining three studies,
this question was second-best, but only by a hair’s breadth – it was almost as
good as the top question.

Reichheld and his team then looked at the Net Promoter Scores of groups of
competitors, and cross-referenced these scores with measures of how well these
companies were growing. The results looked something like this:

![Graph showing correlation between high NPS and high growth](/assets/img/guides/nps/nps-and-growth.png){:class='img-fluid'}

What was the evidence telling them? Companies with high NPS scores are
[more likely to grow](https://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/how-net-promoter-score-relates-to-growth/).

#### But there’s a catch

We’ve touched upon this already, but let’s make it clear:

> Having a Net Promoter Score is a good predictor that a company will grow.
But that **doesn’t mean that getting a high Net Promoter Score is a business
objective**. High NPS comes about when you do business in a way which means your
customers are more likely to be loyal. Measuring NPS fairly and accurately
can help you know if your customer loyalty initiatives are working – but it
isn’t a loyalty initiative itself.

### So how does having a score help at all?

Net Promoter **Score** is the metric at the heart of the **Net Promoter
System**.

The NPS research wasn’t Fred Reichheld’s first rodeo – far from it. He was
already a senior consultant at Bain, helping his corporate clients improve
customer experience, and had quite literally [written the book on
loyalty](http://www.loyaltyeffect.com/loyaltyrules/effect_overview.html).

Because he was already a trusted expert, his 2003 Harvard Business Review
article,
“[The One Number You Need To Grow](https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow)",
very quickly caught the imagination of influential CEOs.

His discovery of a customer loyalty metric that was reliably linked to business
growth was a glass of cold water in the desert to leaders who knew that loyalty
was important, but struggled to improve it: It’s hard to improve what you can’t
make people accountable for, and it’s hard to make people accountable for things
you can’t measure.

Businesses enthusiastically adopted Net Promoter Score, and Reichheld and Bain
helped build a community of good practice around it – allowing these businesses
to share good advice and learn from each other. This community helped establish
the set of behaviours that we now know as the Net Promoter **System** – with the
**score** at its heart.

## What is the Net Promoter System?

NPS is a way of uniting an entire organisation behind the goal of changing
behaviour to improve customer loyalty.

By design, it’s a very ‘low ceremony’ system – there are no complicated
spreadsheets, no consultants’ fees to pay, and only a minimal set of rules to
define what is, and what isn’t NPS. It recognises that different things work for
different people, so in general, if it works for you, you’re free to do it!

NPS says **what** you must do, but leaves a lot of the **how** up to you, as you
know your business best. The three ‘unbreakable rules’ are as follows:


1. You _must_ be able to categorise your customers into ‘promoters’, ‘passives’
   and ‘detractors’, and [calculate your score]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})
   by subtracting your detractors from your promoters. Most commonly this is
   done by asking the **ultimate question** using a 0-10 scale, but you’re
   free to use other questions if they work better for your industry.
2. You _must_ have a ‘closed loop’ process. That is, feedback should be shared
   directly with employees, employees must contact the customers who left
   feedback to address issues raised, and these issues should be shared in
   a systematic way with the rest of the organisation.
3. ‘Success’ and ‘failure’ for the entire organisation  must be framed in terms
   of increasing promoters and decreasing detractors. Of course, businesses will
   measure financial targets as well – but a successful business will only
   incentivise its staff to increase _profit_ in ways that don’t hurt _loyalty_.

![Diagram summarising the Net Promoter System](/assets/img/guides/nps/net-promoter-system.png){:class='float-right ml-5 w-50'}

Although NPS is designed as a way of running an _organisation_, it’s still possible for
teams that are passionate about great customer service to apply a lot of NPS’ ideas
in their own area – and that’s who this guide is for.

If you want to know every single detail about NPS – where it comes from, how it works, and
how to implement it,
[Fred Reichheld’s book is a brilliant read](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Question-Revised-Expanded-Customer-Driven/dp/1422173356).

But if you just want to implement, or improve NPS in your organisation,
based on advice from experts working ‘in the trenches’ with businesses like yours,
use this guide.

We’ll cover some of the key concepts like the **closed loop**, and then go into
detail about how to [calculate your NPS]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})
ways to [improve NPS]({% link _implementing/improving-nps.md %}) and why you
shouldn’t waste your time on [benchmarks]({% link _researching/nps-benchmarks.md %})

## What’s the “NPS closed loop”?

We and the creators of NPS agree strongly on one thing:

> If companies who succeed with Net Promoter had to settle on the single most important key
> to meaningful progress, it might be this: **building customer feedback into their regular
> daily operations** and closing the loop by talking to individual customers and taking
> appropriate action.
> <cite>– Fred Reichheld, The Ultimate Question 2.0</cite>

This ‘closed loop process’ consists of two parts:

* The **inner loop** – front-line team members receive verbatim customer
  feedback, and customers are contacted about their feedback in a timely way.
* The **outer loop** – feedback is used by process improvement teams to make
  better business decisions. These decisions are communicated back to customers
  where possible.

![Diagram summarising the NPS closed loop]({% link /assets/img/guides/nps/nps-closed-loop.png %}){:class='img-fluid'}

Think about it: As a customer, how do you feel when you need to give a company
feedback but you just can’t get in touch? Worse, how do you feel when you give
feedback, but never receive a response?

Implementing the ‘inner loop’ is the single most important investment you can
make to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. If you’re struggling to know
where to begin, do this.

We’ve published an entire guide on how to be brilliant at customer feedback,
including:

* [Which questions to ask]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
* How to [respond]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %}), and
* The benefits of [sharing verbatim feedback with your team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %}).

When, and only when, you’ve closed the inner loop, you can look at
[building the outer loop](http://www.netpromotersystemblog.com/2015/06/12/the-three-qualities-of-the-net-promoter-systems-outer-loop-answering-the-call-for-culture-change-at-att/).
Your team will feel better because they know the wider business has got their
back, and your customers will be delighted that you’re setting your roadmap
based on their feedback.

## What’s Transactional NPS? And Relationship NPS?

Within the Net Promoter System, there are broadly
[two types of survey](https://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/three-types-of-scores.aspx):
(OK, there’s three, but we’ll come back to [benchmarking]({% link _researching/nps-benchmarks.md %})
 later)

* **Transactional Surveys** – Asking customers about a recent experience with you
* **Relationship Surveys** – Asking customers about their overall loyalty to you

Because this is the **practical** guide to NPS, we’re going to cut to the chase
and tell you that one of these surveys is vastly more important than the other:

> If you want to use NPS to improve customer happiness, you should do
> [transactional surveys]({% link _implementing/real-time-customer-feedback.md %})

There’s a place for relationship surveys in a well-run business, but ultimately
the difference is this:

> A good relationship survey will **tell you how happy your customers are**, and
> show you some ways you can start making them happier.
>
> If you’re lucky, the customers you surveyed will still be your
> customers by the time you roll out the improvements you’re making based on the
> survey results.
>
> On the other hand, a good **transactional** survey, with a closed inner loop
> will **make your  customers happier**. Instantly. Today.

So if your goal is happier customers, which are you going to do first?

Put yourself in your customers’ shoes (or just think about your relationship to
companies that you do business with). Do you want to be a number on a
spreadsheet which gets fed into a PowerPoint, which eventually leads to
something, somewhere, maybe changing? Or do you want the chance to have your
issues fixed?

In a perfect world, you should do both, but when we see relationship surveys
recommended over transactional surveys, we see the cart being put before the
horse – or rather _measuring_ customer satisfaction being put before _acting to
improve it_.

## Are there any Criticisms of NPS?

There are many criticisms of NPS – [this article](https://measuringu.com/nps-go/)
does a great job of listing a few and mitigating or debunking them.

But in general, criticism of NPS focuses on criticising the NPS question (i.e.
it’s not a great question to ask), the NPS score (the scale is weird, the
calculation is non-standard), or the comparison/benchmarking of NPS scores (we
agree – don’t do it). The problem with all this criticism is… It largely misses
the point.

_Arguably_ there are better questions to ask, _arguably_ different ways of
calculating the score might yield better results, _arguably_ you shouldn’t
benchmark NPS. But none of that matters.

NPS is a means to an end, not an end goal. The goal is making your customers
happier – because it’s the right thing to do, and because it leads to a more
profitable business.

Remember, all a Net Promoter System is at its core:

1. A consistent score that everyone understands
2. Closing the loop by talking to customers about their feedback
3. Judging success in terms of this score, rather than solely financial metrics.

It’s hard to criticise that.

The best way to make customers happy isn’t to debate different ways of
calculating their happiness, it’s to roll your sleeves up, talk to them, and
make them happy. It helps to have a metric to measure their happiness, and
there’s a huge body of real-world [case studies](/case-studies/) showing that
the NPS question is a good way of doing this in a lot of industries, but if you
object, or you find it’s not working for you, then you can change it for
something that works better.

But first, [listen to your customers]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %}).
