This, and [what questions should we ask?]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
are the two most fundamental questions you need to answer to put together great
customer service surveys. People ask us it all the time.

The question’s very simple, and sometimes the answer is too. But sometimes, for
some businesses, especially if you have a lot of repeat customers or a heavy
support load, the answer can get complicated.

But don’t worry. There is an answer which suits you, and we can help you find
it.

Like everything else in setting up a customer feedback project, this all depends
on [the golden rule]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %}) – __put
yourself in the customer’s shoes__. Like laughter (or a private jet), the
golden rule makes everything easier.

So, if we’re following the golden rule, and putting our customers first, when’s
the right time to request feedback? Let’s look at the options:

* **Periodic customer feedback** For example, annual or quarterly surveys.
* **Real-time customer feedback** For example, automated surveys every time a
  customer buys from you, or after every project you complete.
* **Passive customer feedback** For example, email footers and web forms.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach which will work for every business.
Everyone is different. So let’s think about what our customers want:

1. Customers **don’t** want to change supplier if they can avoid it – this
   is a headache they don’t need
2. Customers **do** want it to be easy to get in touch with you
3. Customers **don’t** want their inboxes full of mail
4. Customers **do** want you to be able to fix their problems at the time they
   happen, not simply receive an apology months later

## The first question
So let’s see how any business, including yours, can give customers what they
want:

The first question we ask someone when we’re helping them design a feedback
schedule is “how frequently do you **do something** for your customers”?

By ‘do something’, we mean interactions like ‘customer places an order’, ‘you
complete a project’, ‘a customer calls your helpdesk and gets a problem
resolved’ or ‘you complete a new sale’. Any touchpoint between the customer and
your business.

If the answer is ‘infrequently’, the answer is simple – send a short survey to
the customer at every touchpoint. It’s best if you automate this, so for
instance, when a call ends in your call-centre software, a survey is sent; or
when a project is completed in your job management system, a survey is sent.
This is **real time customer feedback**.

If your interactions are more complex, you have a few options:

## If your customers are ordering from you multiple times a week

Or you often deal with tricky issues which require multiple calls to a helpdesk
to resolve, real-time surveying may be a bad idea.

In this situation, you’ll get better results from **periodic** and **passive**
customer feedback – for example web forms, or footer links in your email. But if
you take this approach , it’s crucially important that **your customer can find
these forms when they need them**.

[A customer who’s giving you feedback is effectively giving you free money][benefits].
They are giving you the chance to retain their business, or to convert them from
a customer into a brand advocate who will recommend you to their friends and
colleagues. If a customer is kind enough to take time out and give you feedback,
you need to make 100% sure that they find a feedback form before they lose
interest.

One approach that we see great success with is a mix between real-time and
periodic feedback – **rate-limited real-time feedback**. Or, ‘send
a customer a feedback form every time you have an interaction with them
_unless_ you’ve sent them one in the past 3 months.’

This is a pretty good compromise approach. Periodic surveys are rarely a good
idea (we’ll get on to annual surveys, specifically, in just a second); but
real-time surveys can be overwhelming. This way, customers who deal with you
regularly are given a chance to feed back, but aren’t ‘spammed’ with forms so
you don’t loose their goodwill.

## Why you should never, ever use Annual Surveys for Customer Feedback
Lots of companies try to measure and improve customer satisfaction with an
annual survey, only to end up in one of two bad places:

* No increase in customer satisfaction
* No increase in customer satisfaction and a slight increase in attrition

### What goes wrong?
This isn’t rocket science. If you ask all of your customers once a year whether
they’re satisfied, some of them will have had problems 11 months ago. If you’ve
left it this long to ask, do you think they’re going to trust you genuinely
care?

Most people aren’t going to take you seriously, won’t tell you about the
problems they had all those months ago, and won’t give you a chance to put
things right; they’ll just pay closer attention to your competitors in future.

But there’s a problem at the other end of the spectrum as well. If you can get
the [communications]({% link _implementing/survey-response-rates.md %}) right,
people _might just_ trust you enough to give you feedback. And if they
do? Suddenly, your already-busy customer support team have a heap of customer
feedback to comb through, so naturally only the ‘most important’ issues get
dealt with, the rest get filed under ‘good to know’.

Unfortunately, to your customers, their particular feedback is the ‘most
important’ thing. Anyone who raised a problem they wanted you to solve but ended
up in the ‘good to know’ pile isn’t going to thank you for being kind enough to
ask anyway. They’re going to pay closer attention to your competitors

If you can’t reasonably collect feedback in real-time, don’t run an annual
survey. At the very worst, look at quarterly, or every 4 months. Rate-limited
real time feedback (see above) can work well, too – alongside email footers and
web forms.

Most importantly, just follow the golden rules:

* **Rule 0** Always put yourself in your customers’ shoes
* **Rule 1** Make it easy for customers to give feedback
* **Rule 2** Act promptly on all feedback
* **Rule 3** Show the feedback to everyone

It takes a bit more investment than simply blasting out an annual survey, but
the [rewards][benefits] always far outweigh the costs.

## Scheduling real time feedback
If you’re running real-time feedback, there’s one massive factor you need to
consider – you’re not automatically _sending_ surveys, you’re
automatically _scheduling_ surveys.

If you’re running an e-commerce business, it’s no good sending a survey when a
customer completes an order. You need to _schedule_ one for when they’ve
received their goods. If you’re checking that customers are happy with your
sales process, it’s no good sending a survey when you close the deal, you need
to schedule one for when they’re using your service or product.
