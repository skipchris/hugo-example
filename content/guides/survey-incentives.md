If you understand that customer satisfaction is a vital ingredient of business
success then you already know the value of receiving feedback from customers.
And we all want more of a good thing, right?

So, should you offer a prize to encourage more customer feedback?

**If you want the short answer so you can be on your way, it's "No". (Thanks for
stopping by.)**

There is plenty you can do that will be far more effective...

**But offering your valued customers a 99.9% chance of _not winning anything_
is not it.**

The other risk with offering a prize is that you'll increase the amount of
feedback but decrease its usefulness. More *volume* is not necessarily more
**value** if the quality goes down. If you start pulling in more people by
offering a prize you'll find they aren't telling you things that will help you,
they're telling you something to enter the prize draw.

How much constructive criticism will you hear from someone who wants you to give
them a prize?

Offering a prize distorts the results of your surveys and dilutes their value.
As Seth Godin explains,
[customers are not statistics](https://seths.blog/2014/01/different-people-differently/).

**Each customer has a beating heart, a brain...and a choice.**

And they will exercise their choice (spend money or leave) one by one,
individual by individual. So getting more and more responses, averaging them out
and putting them in a slide deck will not be effective in getting those living,
breathing individuals to share more of their bank balance with you.

**But what will work is understanding how each one feels, and responding quickly
and appropriately to whatever the customer has told you.**

So how can you get the chance to find out how more of your customers feel? What
would make a flesh and blood customer desire to give you really useful feedback?
What would make **you** want to give really useful feedback to a company?

Through working with our customers we've found that two factors are by far the
most influential:

## 1. Never let someone feel ignored.
Our everyday experience as customers is that most feedback is ignored. So this
is the most important thing to fix.

**When asking for feedback, give your customer confidence that something will
happen as a result**.

If you can't give that assurance (by your actions, not just your words), then
why would they waste their time telling you?

The sad fact is that most feedback received by most companies really is ignored.
We customers have become accustomed to that and therefore we normally don’t
bother to give feedback.

So if you want any feedback, let alone more, your company needs to behave
differently. Not every response requires action, but the extremes usually do.
Strong praise could indicate a further sales opportunity, a potential referral
or a case study. Strong criticism presents the chance to save a customer who is
at risk (and who is signalling to you their desire to be saved).

If the comment is a suggestion for improvement then acknowledge it, and set an
expectation of whether or when a change can be expected.

**The very best incentive for a customer to give feedback is that you act on the
feedback they have taken the trouble to give.**

Surely that's what they're hoping for when they invest time in responding? Your
customers will love you for it, they will remark on its unusualness to their
friends, and that all translates into more cash in the bank.

Of course, you may object on the grounds that it’s impossible to respond to
every piece of customer feedback.

And I would ask whether you would hold the same view concerning every sales
lead?

## 2. Make it fast and easy to give feedback.
You're already presuming on customers’ good will by asking, so the least you can
do is to make it painless. Be ruthless in keeping it short. And don't worry...

**No customer in the history of the world EVER complained about a satisfaction
survey being too short.**

There's plenty you can do to make your feedback forms more effective and more
enjoyable for customers to use.

## A 'Thank you' is always OK.
If, on the other hand, you want to say 'thank you' because you know that you're
asking someone to invest their time in you then bravo, that's fantastic.

Give something that's genuinely valuable - and give it to everyone who submits
feedback, not just the ‘lucky winner’.

Be generous. Discount vouchers and freebies are a good idea, but it doesn't have
to have a financial value – it could be anything that helps, educates or
entertains. An ebook, hints and tips for getting more from your products and
services, something that's useful,

My local pizza restaurant gives a voucher for free garlic bread after you've
submitted online feedback. It's a nice touch and it means we're likely to return
sooner too. But most importantly - if you do raise an issue, they always follow
up. And we go back more because they prove that they really do care about the
service than because they just asked for feedback.

But to avoid the problems we've considered, it should always be a thank-you, not
an incentive.
