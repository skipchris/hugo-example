So far in this guide we’ve covered the basics –
[what is Net Promoter]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}) and how
do you [calculate it]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})?

But you can’t calculate your score without getting some responses, so we’ll show
you, with examples, how to put together a NPS survey that will give you
**actionable data** and a fantastic **response rate**, and how to send it out to
your customers.

## What’s the point of a Net Promoter Survey?

This might seem painfully obvious – but when we help people with their NPS
projects, this is where we start, because making mistakes here will cause
problems that undermine everything else.

Think of it as a house – if you don’t take time to build good, solid
foundatations, it doesn’t matter how you build the roof, what wallpaper you
pick, or how many bathrooms you have – the house is going to fall down.

NPS was designed as a way of **measuring** loyalty. But, surprisingly, the
biggest mistake we see people make is… Designing NPS surveys to… **measure
loyalty**.

That’s not a typo.

You take your car to a mechanic, and they use a machine to **measure** its
emissions. You go to the doctor, and they use a gizmo to**_measure** your pulse.
And you use a thermometer to **measure** the temperature.

But there’s a huge difference between a satisfaction survey and a thermometer: A
thermometer (sadly) can’t make you warmer, but a feedback form can make or break
customer experience in two ways:

1. **The form itself**. How easy is it to fill in? Are you asking the right
   number of questions? And questions your customers want to answer?
   Does it enhance, or detract from, your brand? How many times have you been
   asked to fill in a "30-second" form, only to walk away in despair when you
   see the "30 page" survey?
2. **What happens next**? It’s a terrible customer experience to be asked for
   feedback, and to have it completely ignored. Like being asked on a date, but
   then being stood up – it’s worse than not being asked at all. But this is
   what most companies do.

No customer, anywhere, wakes up in the morning feeling a burning need to have
their loyalty measured.

So if the **primary** objective of your NPS survey is measuring loyalty, you’re
not going to get great results. However much you try to hide it, all your
decisions will give priority to ‘measuring loyalty’ ahead of anything else
(‘delighting customers’, ‘solving problems’, etc). Your customers will see
through you.

Instead,

> The objective of your NPS survey should be to provide a **brilliant customer
  feedback experience**. It’s fine to measure loyalty **as well**, but it’s
  counterproductive to try and measure loyalty in a way which might decrease it.

You can’t improve the overall experience that customers have of your
organisation if your customer experience improvement projects deliver a poor
experience.

So…

## What questions should be on a NPS survey?

Let’s start with the basics. It’s not a NPS survey without the NPS question:

![The NPS Question]({% link /assets/img/guides/nps/nps-question.png %}){:class='img-fluid'}

But as we’ve just discussed, simply measuring loyalty isn’t a great idea. **You need to set out to
improve it**. And to improve it, we need to get inside our customers’ heads.


The best way to do this is by asking a single, open ended question. There are
[lots of different ways](https://www.wootric.com/blog/how-why-you-should-customize-the-nps-follow-up-question/)
to ask it, so pick one that you feel works best for your circumstances.

But whatever you do, don’t overcomplicate things. Resist the temptation to ask
twenty different open-ended questions: _how are you feeling about our prices
today?_, _how do you feel about the agent you spoke to?_, _how would you
characterise our hold music?_ and _please describe the warm, fuzzy feeling you
have after contacting us_.

[Don’t make them think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think),
and trust that if you give them that one textbox, they will tell you
**everything** you need to know to retain their business.

Then, it’s up to you and your team to keep them happy by
[acting on what they tell you]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %}).

## Can a NPS Survey have more than 2 Questions?

Conventional wisdom holds that NPS is a 2-question survey. We’re here to tell you that it’s
OK to ignore conventional wisdom, and we’ve got the data to prove it.

At CustomerSure, we help the teams who use our platform
[put themselves in their customers’ shoes]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %})
and build feedback processes that those customers love being part of.

When we
[help people put their surveys together]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %}),
we recommend adding a small number of ‘diagnostic’ scored questions, in addition
to the ‘overall satisfaction’ question.

So for example,

* How well did we understand what you wanted?
* How easy were we to deal with?
* How would you rate our speed?
* How well did we communicate?

It’s good to ask questions like these because they’re _aligned with what your
customers want from you_. So customers don’t mind taking a fraction of a second
out of their lives to give you a score.

There’s a “rule” which comes from usability research which says that fewer
questions on a form is _always_ better, and that more questions will _always_
annoy the busy person completing your form and impact your response rate, but
this isn’t quite true.

Like most “rules”, reality isn’t so black-and-white. Yes, overwhelming a form
with pointless questions that customers have no interest in answering will
impact your response rate. But when you add a few carefully-chosen questions
that their customers have a stake in answering, this is the result:

![Abandon rate is lowest for surveys of 6-9 questions](/assets/img/guides/nps/survey-abandon-rate.png){:class='img-fluid'}

If ‘speed of response’ is important to a customer, and they trust that you’re
listening, if they can tell you in under a second how good your speed of
response is, they will.

![Example of a better NPS Survey]({% link /assets/img/guides/nps/nps-survey-with-extra-questions.jpg %}){:class='img-fluid float-left pr-5 pb-5'}{:style='width:40%'}

So it’s OK to ask these extra questions – they aren’t going to upset your
customers and kill your response rate.

In exchange you get a constant ‘temperature check’ on the aspects of your
service which are most important to your customers, and the ability to quickly
put things right if you notice standards slipping.

## What should an NPS Survey Email Look Like?

We’ve already touched upon the ingredients of a great survey email elsewhere in
this guide, but let’s bring them together into a short, easy-to-follow recipe.

![NPS Survey Email]({% link assets/img/guides/nps/nps-survey-email.jpg %}){:class='img-fluid w-50 float-right pl-5 pb-5'}

1. **Care for your customers** – the _only_ reason to send out an NPS survey is to improve loyalty, so be
   prepared to deal with any issues which you hear about from the free-text question.
1. **Show that you care** – The single biggest barrier to customers giving you feedback is that they don’t trust
    you. They’ve been burned too many times before by companies who collected feedback but ignored it.
    Promise that you’re listening, promise that you’re going to put things right, then make good on your promises.
1. **The time is right** – your customers have been also burnt by long, market research exercises
   masquerading as satisfaction surveys. Promise that your survey is going to take no more than 30 seconds
   to complete.
1. **Put a face to a name** – tying into the previous two points – if you’re trying to build trust with your
   customers, including a person’s name and a headshot is a great way to reassure people that you’re listening.
