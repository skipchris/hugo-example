We’ve covered the basics: [What is NPS]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}),
and how do you [calculate it]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})? But how do you go about improving NPS?


## What is the best way to improve NPS?
Now you’re up and running, this section of our guide
contains eight ways to improve your Net Promoter Score. Every single one comes
from our own experience in industry, or from the experience of the heroic
customer contact teams that we’re privileged to call  [our customers](/case-studies/).

But there’s a catch.

Before you use any of these tips, we need you to be 100% sure that **improving
your NPS is the right thing to do**.

We’re serious.

We covered this in the [Intro to NPS]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}),
but it’s important to remember that NPS is a means, not an end. It’s a score that helps gauge the effectiveness of your customer loyalty initiatives, but it isn’t a customer loyalty initiative in itself.

> Anything which promises an increase in your NPS but does not actually make
  your customers’ lives better is a false economy.

Bad metrics are one of the biggest threats to a successful customer satisfaction
improvement project.

It’s totally possible to increase NPS by statistical means, especially if an
executive’s bonus depends on it reaching a certain level. (Seriously, we’ve seen
it happen). But that doesn’t reflect any improvement for customers. It reflects
an unhealthy culture.

An increase in NPS should only ever come from genuine team effort, driven by
customer feedback. In turn, those customers must ‘feel’ the benefits of the
better service claimed by the higher score

Make things fantastic for your customers, trust that revenue growth will follow,
and use NPS to check that your initiatives are having the desired effect.

## 1. Ask at the right time

Want to know how to ruin a first date?

Asking “do you love me?” is a great place to start.

But that’s exactly what many companies do with the Net Promoter Question.

![The NPS Question](/assets/img/guides/nps/nps-question.png){:class='img-fluid'}

It’s a question specifically designed to measure __loyalty__. So it’s a question
that you should only ask when you’ve given customers a chance to become loyal.

Asking it of brand new customers is just like the proverbial “do you love me”?
In the absolute best case scenario, customers will give you a ‘polite’ answer
that doesn’t reflect their true loyalty. In the worst case, customers will be
annoyed at the question and score you a ‘0’.

It’s a good idea to ask new customers for feedback, but don’t use NPS to measure
it. [Other metrics]({% link _researching/customer-satisfaction-metrics.md %})
are available.

## 2. NPS Champions: Take 1

One of the most powerful, but least-discussed benefits of getting verbatim
customer feedback is [the effect it has on your team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %}).

But as a manager, you don’t need to take on all this responsibility yourself.

Naturally, certain parts of your feedback process require personal attention, such as addressing negative feedback directly with the team member involved.

But designating a member of your team as a ‘NPS Champion’ is a great way to set
the tone that customer feedback isn’t something passed down on high from
management, carved on stone tablets – it’s something owned by everyone.

We’ve seen our customers use NPS champions as cheerleaders for the customer
feedback process, for example circulating a summary of the team’s best feedback
from the previous day, or setting up internal ‘NPS league tables’ so teams can
have a little friendly competition to drive up standards.

## 3. NPS Champions: Take 2

Customer experience isn’t just delivered by your front-line staff.

Customer experience is the sum total of **all** the interactions a customer has
with your organisation.

You can drill your customer contact teams to within an inch of their lives, but
if your accounts department are monsters straight out of Ancient Greek
mythology, terrorising your customers; satisfaction levels are going to suffer.

There’s two ways to address this, and it essentially depends on where you sit in
your company’s org chart.

### …You’re in charge
If you’re responsible for implementing NPS across an entire organisation, then
it’s important that you realise that getting __everyone__ behind the objective
of improving loyalty is one of the
[most important concepts]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %})
of implementing NPS.

It's crucial for your entire senior team to support this, regardless of whether their direct reports engage directly with customers.

We’ve seen ‘NPS Champions’ embedded in non-customer-facing business units, and
they work brilliantly. It’s their responsibility to own the NPS project in their
area of the business, even if customer-facing teams are sending surveys and
receiving feedback.

These ‘champions’ make sure that feedback relating to their division gets dealt
with. Rude payment chasers? It’s up to your Finance Champion to organise
training and make sure things change. Missed appointments by your field
technicians? It’s up to your Operations Champion to drive the process
improvement that stops this happening.

### …You’re not in charge
If you’re trying to establish good customer feedback practice on a team, or
division, and you don’t have the authority to influence the behaviour of the
wider organisation, it’s not the end of the world.

You just need to set the tone, and give context to your team. Help them
understand that (for example), there’s a chance they’re going to interact with a
customer who’s angry at something out of their control, and so, whilst 100% NPS
isn’t possible, they can still make a huge difference by trying to delight each
customer as they interact with them.

Never stop advocating for the customer. Show the leaders that you report into
how your customer feedback system has led
to a sustained increase in customer satisfaction, get them on board with what
you’re doing, and make it easy for them to ‘sell’ NPS to the rest of your
organisation.

## 4. Ask more (and better) questions

We discussed this in our guide to [NPS surveys]({% link _researching/nps-surveys.md %}),
but it bears repeating and looking at in more detail:

> There’s nothing wrong with including a handful of
  [customer-centric scored questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
  on your NPS survey. It’s a win-win for you and your customers.

It‘s not much use simply asking ‘if’ somebody would recommend you, without
asking ‘why?’. That’s why the traditional NPS survey consists of the NPS
question and a free-text followup.

The problem with **only** asking for text feedback is that customers who don’t
have especially strong feelings won’t tell you anything. Which is fine! Remember
that this is first and foremost a chance for them to
[tell you how they’re feeling]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %}), so
you can fix it if need be – not a data capture exercise.

However, if you ask questions that are relevant to customers' interests and align with what they value in your service, they are more willing to respond:

![Abandon rate is lowest for surveys of 6-9 questions](/assets/img/guides/nps/survey-abandon-rate.png){:class='img-fluid'}

There’s a hidden benefit to these extra questions: **They can improve the
customer experience**. If a customer’s feeling negative about your organisation,
but positive about the interaction they’ve just had, just asking "would you
recommend us?" puts them in a tight spot. They’ll feel bad about giving you a
low NPS score, even if they genuinely _wouldn’t_ recommend you.

It sounds trivial, but people _hate_ being forced to choose like this. So don’t
make them: Ask the NPS question, and ask some easy-to-answer questions about
their experience.

The answers to the free text question then become more useful. You don’t need to
rely on error-prone text analytics to work out what customers want you to do,
your scored questions are already telling you. Each free text reply is either a
customer asking you for help (so [help them]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %}),
or qualitative data to flesh out the picture that your scored questions are painting.

## 5. Don’t Incentivise Anyone

This is a strange tip to include in our ‘guide to improving NPS’, as it may
lower your NPS score – but by doing so, it can raise customer satisfaction,
which as we’ve discussed is your ultimate goal.

You should never, ever incentivise your staff
[or your customers]({% link _implementing/survey-incentives.md %}) in your
feedback process. That means no Amazon vouchers for customers, and no bonuses
linked to NPS targets for staff.


### Don’t incentivise your staff

This is one of the many, many areas of customer feedback where you can easily
fall victim to Goodhart’s Law, if you’re not careful:

![Goodhart’s Law](/assets/img/guides/goodharts-law.png){:class='img-fluid'}

It’s fine to **measure** how satisfied your customers are. But as soon as you
make it a **target**, and link bonuses to that target, people will come up with
ways to _hit their target_ – whether or not it’s sensible or ethical to do so.

If you incentivise your staff on customer satisfaction, get ready for your staff
inventing ‘creative’ ways to hit high NPS scores, including, but not limited to:
fake feedback submissions, begging customers for high scores, ‘forgetting’ to
ask unhappy customers for feedback, or even bribing customers by giving them
better deals than is commercially sensible.


### Don’t incentivise your customers

This one’s simpler to explain.

How honest do you think customers are if they believe their chance of winning an
iPad (or Amazon vouchers, or a new set of golf clubs, or a holiday in Malibu for
two) rests on how much they flatter you?

Don’t offer to enter your customers into a prize draw in exchange for their
feedback. Even if you’re hoping to [improve response rates]({% link _implementing/survey-response-rates.md %}).

It’s perhaps OK to offer _everyone_ a reward for completing a feedback form, but
it’s not really necessary.

Remember, the point of your feedback process is to give customers a chance to
let you know how they’re feeling. They don’t need a bribe to do that – the
biggest incentive of all is that you’re listening, and you’ll fix their problems
for them.


## 6. Have a great process

It was all going so well.

You sold the customer the product they wanted at a price which was unbeatable.
They had a few post-sales queries, so they called your team, and were blown away
by the service they received.

And then.

Then you sent them a link to your survey via SMS. The SMS interrupted a special
family dinner, which was annoying… But they remembered the message the next day
and clicked the link.

The survey they saw didn’t work well on mobile – they had to scroll left and
right and pinch and zoom, but OK… You had done really well for them, so they
wanted to let you know. Oh, and they really wanted to let you know that the IVR
software they’d had to deal with before speaking to you wasn’t working well.

Except… none of the questions you asked them were about that. The questions you
asked all seemed to be written by your marketing team. They answered a few, and
skipped a few more that sounded more like brain teasers than opportunities to
give honest feedback.

Then, finally at the end of the 5-page survey, you slipped in the Net Promoter
question. Angry and goodwill-exhausted, they rated you ‘6’. And never told you
about the problems with your IVR.

Which is a pity, because it turns out that the IVR is so bad that 25% of your
customers give up without ever getting through to your team. If only you’d
known!

> Your customer feedback process is itself a customer experience.

If you care about great customer service, you need to build a great customer
feedback process. It’s no good focusing all your attention on eye-catching
initiatives like staff training and a shiny website – your customers care as
much, if not more, about how good you are at listening to them.


## 7. Follow up

The [biggest lie in customer feedback]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %})
is that “you can’t respond to every bit of customer feedback”.

We’d turn this on it’s head:

> The **only** reason to ask for customer feedback is if you plan to respond to
it. **The best companies know this and use it as a competitive advantage**.

There is value in using NPS to monitor the success of your customer experience
improvement initiatives, but if you don’t **close the loop** and reply to
feedback where necessary, your NPS surveys are undermining the initiatives
they’re trying to measure.

Some people thinking about trying this worry that it adds cost. On the contrary,
[the amazing teams](/case-studies/) that we work with report that it
**generates profit**.

No customer fills in a feedback form hoping to be ignored.

If you’re just running text analytics on your feedback comments, or worse still
disregarding them completely, the simplest improvement you can make to your NPS
program is to stop making excuses and start replying to customers.

## 8. The Outer Loop

Following up with customers is only
[one of the two so-called ‘loops’]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}) in the
Net  Promoter System.

![NPS Closed Loop Diagram](/assets/img/guides/nps/nps-closed-loop.png){:class='img-fluid'}

The other loop, the ‘outer loop’ (using customer feedback to steer your process
improvements) is also important. Our customers tell us that few things are as
powerful at motivating change as real, verbatim customer feedback, so be sure
you pass customer comments to your organisation’s process improvement teams.

But beware – although process improvement is vital, _it will never deliver 100%
customer satisfaction_.

Why?

Because something can always go wrong. Sometimes it’s people, sometimes it’s IT
systems, sometimes it’s all sorts of other things that mean a great process
fails somehow.

The only way to know if this has happened is to _ask_ a customer and give
them the chance to tell you, so that you can put it right.

So whilst the outer loop is important, don’t attempt it until you’re up and
running with a [customer-centric]({% link _researching/voice-of-the-customer-best-practices.md %})
feedback process, which treats every one of your customers as a potential source
of repeat business and referrals, but most importantly, as a human being.


## In Summary…

There’s one sure way to improve your NPS. Treat every single customer as an
individual, don’t guess if you’ve done a good job for them, **check**, and put
things right if you haven’t.

If only it were as simple to do as it is to say, there would be a lot more
amazing customer service in the world.

But by keeping it as your objective, taking the customer’s side in every
decision you make, and fighting their corner to others in your organisation, you
can go a long way.

In his
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Question-Revised-Expanded-Customer-Driven/dp/1422173356)
which introduced NPS, Fred Reichheld goes to great pains to emphasise one of the
main reasons to do NPS is because “it’s the right thing to do”. Behind every
record in a CMS system is a real human being, with enough going on in their life
that they don’t need the added burden of dealing with companies who don’t care
about them. It just happens that when you do **genuinely care** your business
becomes more profitable.
