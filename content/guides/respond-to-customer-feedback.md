We work with hundreds of organisations all around the world on using feedback to
improve their customer experience. From people who are just getting started, to
innovators who are pushing boundaries in using feedback to increase employee
happiness and drive up revenue; we see and hear a lot of different perspectives.

One thing which **consistently** separates the people who are at the early stage
of their feedback journey from those who are approaching Jedi Master status is
how they deal with responding to customer feedback.

This is because most people who are just getting started with feedback still
believe the biggest lie in the industry ‚Äì

> Although customer feedback is a good thing, you cannot deal with every
> response to satisfaction surveys

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This lie sounds completely reasonable because all the most convincing deceptions
have their roots in truth. And it is true that dealing with every response takes
more effort than ignoring them; or putting them all in a spreadsheet
and using them to draw a graph.

But, time and time again, we see one crucial difference between businesses who
are turning feedback into measurable profit increases, and those who aren‚Äôt:
**dealing with feedback**.

So let us help you get there. We‚Äôll look at why people believe this lie so
passionately, and then show why it‚Äôs a lie. And then, we‚Äôll share some
strategies to help you get *your* organisation dealing with every piece of
feedback you receive.

## The easy way out
So often in life, it‚Äôs easiest to take the path of least resistance. To stay in
bed rather than go out for a run on a cool winter‚Äôs morning. To order-in pizza
rather than cook a meal.

To completely **ignore** customer feedback, rather than **respond** to it.

At risk of stating the obvious, responding to customer feedback is a two-step
process. First you must *read* customer feedback, before you even think about
how you‚Äôre going to respond.

And that‚Äôs one of the main reasons that many organisations are intimidated by
the suggestion that they should respond to feedback. The familiar voices in
their head tell them that that taking the easy option is just as good as the
alternative.

But whilst the voices in our head are a powerful influence, they‚Äôre not
always reliable advisors. If you want to get a
flavour for the many many different tricks our minds play on us, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">Wikipedia has a
whole list for you</a>.

To defeat your enemy, you must first understand them, so let‚Äôs look at the ways
we deceive ourselves into believing that ignoring customer feedback is a good
idea.

## 1. Information Avoidance

> "But people often avoid information that could help them to make better
decisions if they think the information might be painful to receive. Bad
teachers, for example, could benefit from feedback from students, but are much
less likely to pore over teaching ratings than skilled teachers,"
<cite>Carnegie Mellon University</cite>

Ever put off checking your bank balance, even though you were worried about the
timings of payments leaving your account? Or put off a visit to the doctor
because you were worried about bad news?

You‚Äôve fallen victim to the veryy real, studied, psychological phenomenon called
[Information Avoidance](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/march/information-avoidance.html)

If there‚Äôs bad news in the bank, doctor‚Äôs surgery, or your customer feedback,
it‚Äôs still there whether you look at it or not. If your customers are angry at
you, they‚Äôre angry, whether you reply to them or not. It won‚Äôt go away just
because you don‚Äôt look at it.

But, if you summon up the courage to look at your feedback, and the greater
courage to actually start replying,
[magic happens]({% link _improving/dealing-with-complaints.md %}).

The good news is, that most of the feedback you‚Äôll receive will be
overwhelmingly positive. We crunched the numbers on our database of millions of
feedback scores, and this is what we found:

![Graph showing how often feedback scores 0-10 are received. 10, 9, 8 are very common, other scores far less so](/assets/img/guides/feedback-score-frequencies.png){:class='img-fluid'}

The feedback that people are ducking? **Most of it is good news**.

## 2. The ‚Äòsunk cost‚Äô fallacy

> Imagine you go see a movie which costs $10 for a ticket. When you open your
wallet or purse you realize you‚Äôve lost a $10 bill. Would you still buy a
ticket? You probably would.
>
> Only 12 percent of subjects said they wouldn‚Äôt.
Now, imagine you go to see the movie and pay $10 for a ticket, but right
before you hand it over to get inside you realize you‚Äôve lost it. Would you go
back and buy another ticket? Maybe, but it would hurt a lot more.
> <cite>[You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/)</cite>

This is the ‚Äòsunk cost fallacy‚Äô. Once you‚Äôve spent time or money on something,
it becomes terribly difficult to leave that thing behind ‚Äì even if carrying on
with it is a terrible idea.

The sunk cost fallacy can work hand-in-hand with information avoidance to push
you away from reading customer feedback. You‚Äôve already spent so much time and
money on putting procedures in place, and training your staff ‚Äì what if your
customer feedback shows you‚Äôll have to throw out that investment and start
again?

It‚Äôs seductive to just ignore the feedback and not face up to the fact that you
**may** have to rethink things. But if things need re-thinking, burying your head
in the sand won‚Äôt help that.

## 3. Fear of Change

> Where does the other road lead? How long will it take? Is it dangerous? What
we don‚Äôt know tends to scare us, and change creates a lot of things we don't
know. As a result, we tend to act pretty irrationally to try and prevent
change, often without realizing it, and make our lives unnecessarily
problematic.
> <cite>[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5982622/why-youre-so-afraid-of-change-and-what-you-can-do-about-it)</cite>

Fear of change is linked with the previous two points, but stands alone as one
of the greatest tricks your mind can play on you.

No matter how great the ‚Äònew thing‚Äô on offer, most people‚Äôs minds are very
change resistant, and will throw up many, many barriers to avoid having to deal
with change.

Why?

[Writing in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2013/04/08/why-were-so-afraid-of-change-and-why-that-holds-businesses-back/),
Andrea Simon, PhD, identifies three reasons:

* **Habits are efficient**: Your habits are great at helping you getting your
  current job done quickly, but as a result, your brain fiercely defends these
  habits from uncomfortable new ideas disrupting them.
* **Change is tiring**: learning something new involves a lot of work in your
  prefrontal cortex. As your brain uses up to 25% of your energy, learning new
  things is literally exhausting, so we put it off.
* **You need to experience change to understand it**: reading about good ideas
  is seldom enough for your brain to understand why they‚Äôre good. It‚Äôs only when
  you‚Äôre experiencing the idea that your brain can lay down new pathways which
  help you understand how good it is.

In short ‚Äì change is hard work, so our brains throw down massive mental anchors
to ensure we avoid it as much as possible.

## The alternative

So, your mind can play tricks that keep you from taking advantage of
opportunities.

**But the opportunity in replying to feedback is massive.**

CustomerSure is all about using feedback to effect real change in your
organisation ‚Äì change which leads to a  [happier team]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %}),
and a measurable increase to your bottom line.

You can follow every other piece of advice in our guides, but if you‚Äôre not
replying to feedback, you‚Äôre missing out on some of the biggest benefits. In
fact, you *could* be undermining everything all your other good work. Think
about it ‚Äì¬†what‚Äôs more annoying to you, as a customer? Not being asked, or being
asked, taking time to give your views, and then being ignored?

Your customers have spent a lot of time coming to a buying decision. They‚Äôve
read and absorbed your marketing messages and compared your price, and decided
that you‚Äôre the business for them. They don‚Äôt *want* to switch to your
competitors. That would take time and energy that they could better spend taking
long walks on the beach (or doing their day job, whatever suits). But if they‚Äôre
telling you about problems and you‚Äôre not responding, they will summon up the
energy to switch.

When you demonstrate that you‚Äôre listening, and responding to any problems
they‚Äôve had, you give people no reason to spend energy looking at your
competitors. Why would they? When things go well, they go well. When things go
badly, you put them right. They‚Äôre in a win/win situation.

It‚Äôs not enough to automatically analyze feedback, spot trends, make lists of
‚Äòareas for improvement‚Äô, and deploy new initiatives 18 months after the feedback
was given. The customers who gave the feedback have already left, and can‚Äôt be
brought back without a significant sales and marketing investment.

## How to get started
CustomerSure began, when our founder, Guy Letts took up a new position with
responsibility for customer service at one of the UK‚Äôs largest software firms.

He (literally) blew the dust off two years' worth of annual satisfaction
surveys. In them he discovered hundreds of opportunities that had been missed to
retain exasperated customers, and cursed at how unnecessarily difficult his new
job had became.

> "Wouldn't it be great‚Ä¶"

 he thought,

> "To be a customer of a company that made sure I was completely happy every
time I dealt with them? And if I wasn't happy, for some reason, then it would be
fixed straight away? Not by asking me once a year and averaging my views with
those of everyone else, but by taking the trouble to check that I'm happy with
the service I've just received."

Yes!

Yes, it would.

It would mean hard work. It would mean ongoing **feedback and action**, rather
than annual **survey and reflection**. It would mean a leap of faith: that the
extra effort would not cause targets to be missed, and it would need some
technology to help check for satisfaction and respond rapidly.

Guy couldn't change how the company as a whole operated, but could do it in the
department for which he was responsible.

Besides, he had tried pretty much everything else he had read in the text books
and the customer satisfaction dial had not even flickered.

What was there to
lose?

## The results were rapid and revolutionary.
Year on year he averaged a **10% increase in customer satisfaction scores**.
Customer retention improved as a direct consequence. Which also helped ensure he
never missed his annual profit target. Three years later, he realised that this
wasn‚Äôt a fluke, so started CustomerSure to help other businesses get the same
results.

There are two key takeaways here:

1. Guy‚Äôs initial insight came from *putting himself in the customer‚Äôs shoes* ‚Äì
what did they want? What would keep them loyal? Replies!
2. Guy didn‚Äôt try and boil the ocean. It can take years to get top-down approval
for this type of project at a massive international enterprise, so Guy just
changed the bit of the world he was responsible for. His team loved it, and word
quickly spread about the great results he was achieving, meaning the process
organically took root elsewhere in the business.

So if you‚Äôre struggling to see how to start, just pick the smallest subset of
feedback you think you can respond to, take a deep breath, and start responding
to it. Your customers will be delighted that you did.
