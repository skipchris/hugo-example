Let‚Äôs get one thing straight before we start:

A wise farmer once said,

> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt fatten a pig by weighing it.‚Äù ‚Äì üêñ

Or,

__Measuring__ customer satisfaction is not the same thing as __improving__
satisfaction.

This is the single biggest missed opportunity in customer service improvement.
Worldwide, in every industry, firms realise that satisfaction is important, so
try and measure it by gathering customer feedback.

But they gather data about satisfaction in a way which does **nothing** to
improve satisfaction. Or worse, a way that **decreases** satisfaction.

You wouldn‚Äôt measure rooms in your house with a tape measure that put holes in
the wall. You wouldn‚Äôt check the temperature of a glass of water by pouring
mercury into it and hoping for the best, but time and time again, companies try
to measure satisfaction in a way which annoys their customers.

**Pro tip**: That doesn‚Äôt end well.

Which is why, if we may be so blunt, if you haven‚Äôt got the basics right, it
genuinely _does not matter_ which metric you pick.
[NPS]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}), CSAT, CES, ‚Ä¶ or something
exciting and home-grown.

They‚Äôre all decent measures, and we‚Äôll walk you through the pros and cons of
each, but if your ultimate goal is happier customers (that **is** your ultimate
goal, right?), none of them will make your customers happier.

So work out how you‚Äôre going to do that first.

## So why bother picking one at all?
There‚Äôs one good reason to measure satisfaction ‚Äì it makes it easier to talk
about.

Once you‚Äôre measuring satisfaction accurately and fairly, you can‚Ä¶

* Report to your board whether your initiatives are working, and win their
  confidence.
* Keep your team focused on a number they trust and believe in
* Try to [benchmark]({% link _improving/benchmarking-customer-satisfaction.md %})
  against your competitors (although it‚Äôs pointless to do so).

So, it‚Äôs totally **fine** to measure satisfaction.

What isn‚Äôt fine, is trying to measure it before you‚Äôve got a concrete plan to
improve it.

## What does make a difference?
We‚Äôve decades of experience in improving customer service.

We‚Äôve seen methodologies, metrics, and fads come and go ‚Äì ISO 9000, Six Sigma,
NPS, Social Customer Service, Agile, Chatbots (remember them?), and now AI ‚Äì all
promising to totally revolutionise customer service.

![A friendly chatbot](/assets/img/guides/chatbot.webp){:class="float-md-right ml-5 mb-5 w-50 shadow"}

But just think about your own experience‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶is customer service in general better than it was 10 years ago? Or 20? If any
of these things were the ‚Äòsilver bullet‚Äô that actually delivered perfect
customer service, surely customer service would be great by now?

All of these methods are fine, but they‚Äôre just tools to get the job done, not
magic that can save a company that‚Äôs got the fundamentals wrong.

We want you to be successful ‚Äì with happier customers and a happier team. So,
before we break down which metric to choose, we‚Äôll look at the **three
fundamental things** you need to get right first: **Culture**, **Strategy** and
**Execution**. Get them wrong, and you‚Äôll struggle to improve satisfaction ‚Äì¬†no
metric can save you.

Then, we‚Äôll compare the three the most popular satisfaction metrics, and help
you work out which is best for you.

### 1. Culture.
A powerful thing happens when you ask a customer for feedback.

Your customer will start to dare to believe that your company cares.

Not whether _you_ care - you wouldn‚Äôt be doing it otherwise, but whether there
is a goal shared by everyone in your company to deliver great service.

You cannot deliver great service by yourself; it requires everyone in every role
to commit. And unless your company culture expects that everyone will deliver
great service, customers won‚Äôt experience great service.

What‚Äôs rewarded in your company? What values are upheld consistently? What
behaviours are modelled? What do people get praised for? What‚Äôs valued?

> Until every leader and everyone has a shared vision and commitment to
delivering great service there is no metric, technique or silver bullet that
will improve customer service.

You need to fix culture first. Paying lip service isn‚Äôt enough, it has to be
ingrained in the DNA of the company that better service leads to better
financial performance.

This requires belief and attitude, not rules, scripts and tick boxes.

#### Don‚Äôt pick a metric until you can honestly say‚Ä¶

* The leaders in your company are all committed to delivering great service
* Every department in your company (yes, that includes Finance, IT and Sales)
* are bought into the vision Everyone understands that customer satisfaction
* isn‚Äôt a fluffy nice-to-have, it leads to a better bottom line

If you‚Äôre fortunate and you‚Äôre in a company where that‚Äôs all in good shape, then
read on.

### 2. Strategy.

Great, so everyone in your company 100% understands that happier customers leads
to a happier bottom line, and that it‚Äôs **everyone‚Äôs** job to make them happy.

What are you going to do about it?

We‚Äôre sure the budget airline who send us a 57-page customer survey every single
time we travel with them genuinely do want happier customers. And the hotel
chain who send us **5** nagging survey reminders every time we use one of their
conference rooms are probably keen on the _idea_ of customer satisfaction.

It just feels like‚Ä¶¬†Perhaps they haven‚Äôt thought things through.

> Culture is great, but unless you have a crystal-clear plan for how you‚Äôre
going to use customer feedback in your business, it‚Äôs better not to bother
asking.

Who‚Äôs going to feel good about your brand after wading through 57 pages of
questions only of interest to your marketing team?

Are nagging ‚Äòreminder emails‚Äô a frontier-pushing customer experience? Or just a
way of artificially inflating [response rate]({% link _implementing/survey-response-rates.md %})?

And even if customers do eventually get ground down by your reminders, and slog
through your mammoth, boring survey, what are you going to do with the
responses?

Because if you‚Äôre just hoping to use them in a process improvement project one
day, then all the customers who have left you feedback **begging you to solve
their problems now** will have switched to a competitor long before you get
round to tackling the underlying issues.

#### Don‚Äôt pick a metric until you can answer these questions‚Ä¶

1. When are customers most likely to want give feedback?
2. How easy can we make it for them?
3. What does each customer reasonably expect to happen after they
   have given feedback?

### 3. Execution.

Staying with that final point, **What does each customer
[reasonably expect to happen]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %})
after they have given feedback?**

alt="Diagram summarising how to get the most out of customer feedback">
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Why customer feedback improves customer experience</figcaption>
</figure>

The answer? Customers might want you to
[respond]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %})

They might not want to be put in a spreadsheet and drawn on a graph. They might
have a problem which they need you to fix, and quickly.

If you‚Äôre committed to service, you need to be prepared to fix those problems.

Not in ‚Äúup to 5 business days‚Äù. Seriously? If I walked into a bricks-and-mortar
store and asked a question, it would be OK to make me stand waiting 5 days for
an answer?

Of course not - so it‚Äôs definitely not OK to make someone who‚Äôs taken time out
of their busy day to give you feedback wait that long either.

It‚Äôs totally fine to collect feedback and use the results for process
improvement, but if you don‚Äôt want to **decrease customer satisfaction by simply
asking for feedback** you need to be set up to deal with the responses as they
arrive.

(**Pro tip**: This is one of the reasons why
[annual surveys]({% link _implementing/real-time-customer-feedback.md %})
are a bad idea)

### Don‚Äôt pick a metric until‚Ä¶

1. You know how you‚Äôll make the _whole_ process of giving feedback a great
   experience for your customers, especially what happens after they have given it.
2. You‚Äôve got processes for short term and long term follow-up on feedback to
   make sure you increase customer satisfaction instead of just measuring it.
3. You‚Äôve put a date in the diary to review and refine how you collect and act on
   feedback to make sure it is delivering customer and company benefits. It would
   be odd if you didn‚Äôt ask what customers think of your feedback process too!

## How to choose the best customer satisfaction metric for your company.

Ok, now you‚Äôve sorted the essentials:

* Culture
* Planning
* Execution

‚Ä¶You‚Äôve guaranteed that your effort to **measure** satisfaction isn‚Äôt going to
‚Ä¶**decrease** satisfaction.

It‚Äôs time to pick a metric!

We‚Äôll look at the pros and cons of three of the most popular metrics ‚Äì¬†NPS, CSAT
and CES.

## Net Promoter Score.
Billed as the ‚Äò[ultimate question]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}), this
technique usually (though [not always]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %}))
involves asking the question, ‚Äú_How likely is it that you would recommend our
company to a friend or colleague?_‚Äù

Respondents are then characterised as promoters, passives or detractors
according to the score they give you.

[NPS is calculated]({% link _researching/how-to-calculate-nps.md %})
on a scale from -100% to +100%. A positive score indicates that your company
will grow, negative means it is likely to decline.

NPS has a few benefits:

- A score out of 10 is simple for your customer - It‚Äôs widely understood and
  there are [lots of products available](http://www.netpromotersystem.com/resources/vendors.aspx).
- It‚Äôs a strong measure of sentiment. Being prepared to wholeheartedly ‚Äòrecommend‚Äô
  is a tougher test than just asking whether I am satisfied myself.
- NPS is more  than a score, it has evolved into a full system, which
  emphasises the importance of ‚Äò[closing the loop]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %})‚Äô
  that is, following up with customers.

In our experience, if you do NPS correctly, it has few drawbacks. The only
significant one is that the ‚Äòrecommend‚Äô question isn‚Äôt appropriate for all
circumstances (_but even then, NPS allows you to ask another question if you
really, really want to!_)

Trouble is, a lot of people don‚Äôt do NPS well, and so introduce a few problems.
Here‚Äôs some common ones we see:

* **Using NPS as a customer-facing score**. Most customers don‚Äôt know what it is
* **Only asking the NPS question**. Customers want to answer customer-centric
  questions. Make sure your [NPS survey]({% link _researching/nps-surveys.md %})
  also asks questions they care about, rather than just the ‚Äòrecommend‚Äô question
  which _you_ care about.
* **Focusing on the number** ‚Äì it‚Äôs great that you have
  your Net Promoter Score to simplify conversations around satisfaction, but it‚Äôs
  important to not obsess about that score. Instead, obsess about doing things
  that make customers happier.

### Use NPS if‚Ä¶
* It makes sense to ask questions about ‚Äòloyalty‚Äô. NPS might not be right if
  you‚Äôre a monopoly, or asking the question early in a customer journey.
* You‚Äôre going to commit to the full NPS system, including closing the loop with
  individual customers.


## CSAT
There‚Äôs no one fixed, ‚Äòofficial‚Äô definition of what CSAT is.

Everyone agrees it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúask your customers if they‚Äôre satisfied‚Äù, but
after that, all bets are off.

You can use any scale, ask the question in any way, and do anything you like
with the results, and still call it CSAT.

In our view, that‚Äôs not a massive problem.

As long as you‚Äôre doing all the other bits of your feedback process right
(asking customer-centric questions at the right time, and following up on the
responses), it‚Äôs fine to ask customers how satisfied they are.

Here‚Äôs a few pointers to help you get it right:

* Don‚Äôt get customer feedback mixed up with
  [market research]({% post_url 2018-04-25-market-research-vs-satisfaction-surveys %}).
  It truly doesn‚Äôt matter what [scale]({% link _implementing/survey-ratings-scales.md %})
  you use, so long as customers understand it and can answer it easily. It
  doesn‚Äôt matter if you ‚Äòbias‚Äô the scores in any way, because you‚Äôre not trying
  to do statistics, you‚Äôre trying to find problems and fix them.
* Because ‚Äòanything goes‚Äô with CSAT,
  [benchmarking]({% link _improving/benchmarking-customer-satisfaction.md %})
  CSAT against your competitors is an even worse idea than ever. They‚Äôre
  probably not calculating it the same as you, and the comparison is totally
  meaningless.
* Like NPS, don‚Äôt just ask the ‚Äòsatisfaction‚Äô question. Ask some diagnostic
  questions, both scored and free text to understand why customers are
  (dis)satisfied, and to give you an opportunity to fix problems.

Problems with CSAT?

Like NPS, a lot of the criticisms of CSAT (see
[this article](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-satisfaction-score) for
a few) can be answered with a shrug and a ‚Äò_so what_‚Äô?

* It‚Äôs true that **cultural bias** probably is a factor, the scores are
**subjective** and there might be a **bias** in that indifferent customers can‚Äôt
be bothered to fill your survey in, but they miss the point: the accuracy of
your score isn‚Äôt anywhere near as important as what you do with the feedback you
receive.
* That said, [Some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016748709500007B)
suggests that the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty isn‚Äôt
straightforward. Just because a customer is ‚Äòsatisfied‚Äô, doesn‚Äôt mean they will
stick around.

### Use CSAT if‚Ä¶
* You want to keep things simple NPS isn‚Äôt a good question to ask at a given
* point in the customer journey


## Customer Effort Score (CES)
Like NPS,
[Customer Effort Score](https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers) was first
introduced to the world in the weighty Harvard Business Review.

Its creators, Matthew Dixon, Karen Freeman and Nicholas Toman argue, based on
studying over 75,000 customer interactions, that **great customer service is
very bad at producing loyal customers**.

Customers are loyal to great products and powerful brands. Customer service
interactions can only do a little to improve loyalty, but can do a lot to
destroy it (this probably feels familiar if you‚Äôve ever been on the receiving
end of bad customer service!)

So, they argue, if you‚Äôre trying to ‚Äòmeasure‚Äô customer service, it makes no
sense to try and measure the ‚Äòbest case scenario‚Äô ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt matter if some
customers are delighted if the majority are frustrated. Instead, the metric they
propose is more of a ‚Äòworst case scenario‚Äô:

> ‚ÄúHow much effort did you personally have to put forth to handle your request‚Äù

(Measured on a scale from 1 (very low effort) to 5 (very high effort)).

CES‚Äô creators claim that it has greater predictive power of future customer
behaviour than NPS (and far greater than CSAT).

We like CES because the question itself is customer-centric (no customer wants
to put a lot of effort into sorting out problems caused by an organisation). But
remember ‚Äì¬†as with all metrics, make sure it‚Äôs not the **only** question you ask.
(Read [our guide to customer survey questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
if you need help working out what to ask).

### Use CES if‚Ä¶
* You‚Äôre measuring a single customer interaction, not a relationship * You‚Äôre
wary of over-investing in customer service, by spending money on lavish things
customers don‚Äôt want, rather than just getting the basics right.

## Conclusion
**Be very clear about why you‚Äôre doing customer feedback.**

Metrics and process improvement are important, but you‚Äôll struggle to improve
‚Äòcustomer satisfaction‚Äô unless you improve the satisfaction of individual
customers. One by one. Just exactly the same way that you won them as customers
in the first place.

So the main goal should not be about gathering data. The main goal should be to
check that the experience of every individual customer is excellent every time
they deal with you, and to fix it straight away if something has gone wrong.

Improving your processes can then be done just as well, and probably better, as
a by-product of the data you collect when you‚Äôre achieving that more important
goal.

**The most important thing to remember is that success is governed by principles
that are far more important than which customer satisfaction metric you
choose.**

These factors have much more impact:

- [When you ask]({% link _implementing/real-time-customer-feedback.md %}) for
  feedback;
- how fast and easy you make it for the customer to give feedback;
- what other [questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %}) you ask;
- whether, how and how quickly you [respond]({% link _implementing/respond-to-customer-feedback.md %})
- [who in your company]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md%}) gets to see
  customer comments.

Once you‚Äôve got the basics covered, and only then, how should you decide which
metric to use?

1. You could just pick a metric you like. Providing you get the more important
   factors right then almost any metric can be made to work well. If you want
   help choosing the right one for your needs, just ask us!
1. A combination could be best - CES for transactions and NPS for relationships
   and loyalty.
1. CSAT is good if you don‚Äôt have a strong preference for one of the others and
   you just want something that‚Äôs easy for your customers and your staff to
   understand.

Whichever one you choose, you‚Äôre now equipped for happier customers, a happier
boss, and a happier team!
