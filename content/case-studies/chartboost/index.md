* __Company__ [Chartboost](https://www.chartboost.com/)
* __Location__ San Francisco, US

Chartboost is a technology company based in San Francisco and their fun loving
culture is evident in the playful design of their offices.

Although their work is about fun &amp; games they're deadly serious about
customer service.

They were already working hard on service, but they felt they could strengthen
their business by doing even better, and they wanted to benefit from having
customer feedback integrated into their processes.

We interviewed Manager of Support Operations, Dave Sheehan.

## Tell us about Chartboost

Chartboost is the leading global mobile game advertising platform. We help game
developers build a business through facilitating monetization, user acquisition
and promotion.

We work hard and play hard, our business is after all, games!

We pride ourselves on being a fair play and transparent advertiser. Part of that
is providing outstanding service to all of our developers.

> We wanted evidence to assure developers that we had outstanding support service.

## What challenges were you facing?
We knew we were doing good things based on anecdotal feedback but we suspected
there were ways that we could really improve.

We also wanted evidence in the form of solid numbers and facts that our
business team could use to assure developers that we had outstanding support
service.

We looked hard at the market offering customer feedback solutions. We liked
CustomerSure because it was customizable, allowed for more than thumbs up/thumbs
down or happy/sad face feedback, and which integrated easily into our Zendesk
automation.
