* __Company__ [Covéa Insurance](https://www.coveainsurance.co.uk/)
* __Location__ Halifax, UK

Covéa Insurance Plc is the UK underwriting business of leading French mutual
insurance group Covéa.

One of the **top 75 employers** in West Yorkshire and Humber, and the winner
of multiple industry awards, they have a longstanding commitment to an
effective Voice of the Customer programme.

They knew that to improve further, they needed a more flexible software platform,
and a trusted partner to help with implementation.

We interviewed Tom Hepworth, Research & Insight Manager.

## What challenges were you facing?

Getting insight from our customers and broker partners is invaluable to us as a
business, but we wanted to ensure we were doing so in the most **engaging and
efficient way**.

Over the past few years, we had rapidly grown our Voice of Customer programme
but due to varying system constraints, it was becoming increasingly
inefficient.

> We needed the ability to be agile and drive our programme in real time.

## How did CustomerSure help?

We were looking for a provider that would enable us to be both proactive and
reactive in collecting feedback. CustomerSure gives us that.

[Their platform]({% link product/index.html %}) allows us to build, launch and amend surveys in
real-time. This has proven priceless on several occasions, letting us create
quick, targeted surveys focussed on specific elements of the customer journey.

By doing this, we get fast, reliable feedback on what delights and frustrates
our customers and broker partners at different points.

## What results have you achieved?

Using the CustomerSure platform and [working with their great team]({% link working-together/index.html %}),
we have been able to enhance our Voice of Customer programme substantially.

The **agile nature of the tool** has led to us regularly reviewing our question-sets
whilst monitoring newer areas of our journeys. A key driver of this has been to
ensure we are providing good outcomes to our customers across all touchpoints.

We’ve also not been afraid to trial new approaches or questions to understand
what additional insight they can provide. In most cases this has added true
value to the business — in a couple it hasn’t, however that’s the capability of
the tool — allowing you to try, fail fast and make improvements.

Another focus for us was to increase our survey and response rates and the tool
has allowed us to do that by conducting A|B testing with invitation messaging.

> We’ve seen really strong increases on response rates as a result.

## Has there been anything memorable in the feedback you’ve received?

The standout for us as a company, is the volume of feedback we receive
highlighting the phenomenal service colleagues interacting with customers
provide. We’re so proud of this, we regularly
[share feedback across our teams]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %})
so everyone is aware of what we do.

Verbatim feedback has also been a fantastic tool for internal recognition – We
make sure to feedback to colleagues where a customer has mentioned them by
name, so they know their efforts make a difference.

## What would be your advice to somebody who’s about to start a Voice of the Customer project?

Don’t get bogged down by a specific [metric]({% link _researching/customer-satisfaction-metrics.md %})
or a target you’ve been set. Explore what your customers are telling you and
embrace that feedback – positive or negative.

> Comments from customers are real and genuine; they expect to be listened to.

Asking the [right questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
and in the right format is key. Ask questions where feedback can make a difference
within your business; and make sure your colleagues are prepared and equipped to
take that feedback on board; and drive actions from it.

Finally, find a voice of customer partner who reflects the values you have, and
can support your way of working. <b>We feel we have found that in CustomerSure</b>.
