## Tell us about Optimus

[Optimus](https://www.optimus-move.co.uk) is a tech company based in the
property services sector. We provide conveyancing and home surveys via a
technology platform connected to a nationwide panel of conveyancers and
surveyors. Working alongside our panels, Optimus have a expert service team who
ensure the performance of their panels and support the end-to-end home moving
process to deliver a high level of service across the customer journey.

## Why were you looking for a Voice of the Customer platform?

Optimus wanted to work closer with customers to understand their pain points and
things that could be improved throughout the process. Also ensuring that any
changes being implemented with partners are really benefiting the customers.

Another requirement was having intelligent reporting, and multiple channels
available with the ability to send surveys that integrate with numerous
processes throughout the business.

The previous feedback tool had limitations and was not adaptible enough for our
business needs.

## How did the implementation go?

It was quick to get CustomerSure up and running. A very supportive
team at CustomerSure worked closely with us to develop the
platform to meet our needs.

> I would describe CustomerSure as friendly, responsive, and supportive.

After going live, we were looking forward to clearer communication being shared
to all parties, **and this objective was definitely fulfilled**.

## What results have you achieved?

We have now got enhanced data transparency with introducers, and we can utilise
the feedback to help navigate decisions around service offerings.

Delighted to say due to
[CustomerSure’s partnership approach]({% link working-together/index.html%}) and sharing best
practice, response rates and feedback quality have both increased as time has
gone on.

## What advice would you give to others considering a VoC project?

The more you know about your customer journeys and key points in these journeys
the better. Time invested in mapping these journeys and understanding the wants
and needs of different customer groups across the journeys is time well spent.

**We are glad that we met the team at CustomerSure and are looking forward to
developing our relationship in the coming years.**
