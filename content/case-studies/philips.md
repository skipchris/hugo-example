[Philips](https://www.philips.co.uk/), a global leader in innovation, is
committed to enhancing people’s lives through meaningful products.

The Philips Sonicare brand, known for its popular dental care products, sought
to engage dental professionals, gather valuable feedback, and raise brand
awareness within this crucial customer segment across Western Europe and the
US.

This case study takes a closer look at the ongoing partnership Philips has with
CustomerSure through our ever-evolving Global Supplier Agreement.


## The Partnership So Far

Since early 2021, CustomerSure has been proud to collaborate with the
multinational conglomerate, Philips, specifically working with their Sonicare
brand in the UK. This partnership expanded to Western Europe in the summer of
2022 and has now reached across the Atlantic, including the USA.

The success of this collaboration lies in addressing the unique needs of Philips
Sonicare’s customer feedback program, emphasising ease of use, multilingual
capabilities, comprehensive training, and flexible reporting.

## The Challenge:

The primary challenge was to design a customer feedback program that catered to
the extensive requirements of a company as sizeable as Philips.

Specific challenges included ensuring ease of use for the Sonicare Field Team,
implementing multilingual surveys in 10 languages (English, French, German,
Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Hebrew), offering
comprehensive training and support across multiple countries, providing
friendly and committed service, and delivering flexible reporting tailored to
stakeholders’ roles.



## The CustomerSure Approach:

> a user-friendly feedback program. The platform enabled the Sonicare Field Team
> to seamlessly collect feedback, whether in-person or via follow-up emails.

The incorporation of surveys in 10 languages ensured inclusivity and
accessibility, reflecting the diverse regions in which Philips operates.
Comprehensive training and support, combined with CustomerSure’s
[renowned friendly service](/working-together/), became the cornerstone of the
collaboration.



## The Results


Commencing in the UK in 2021 and expanding across Europe in 2022,
CustomerSure’s successful collaboration with Philips Sonicare extended to the
USA in the latter quarter of 2023. The partnership now spans key territories,
including the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Israel, Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the USA.
