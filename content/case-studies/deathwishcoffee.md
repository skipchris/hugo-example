## Tell us about Death Wish Coffee
In 2012, Death Wish Coffee Co. started in a small coffee shop in Saratoga
Springs, NY. Founder Mike Brown saw a need for coffee that was both strong and
delicious to serve his groggy morning customers. After creating the perfect
blend of beans and combining it with his unique roasting technique, the
__'World's Strongest Coffee'__ was born. Today, thousands of people trust
Death Wish Coffee to wake them up and keep them going every day.

## What challenges were you facing?
We knew our audience were growing rapidly, and we needed to ensure we grew with
them.To ensure this, we needed to ask them the right questions to yield
improvements; but we didn’t want to ask __TOO__ many questions. Most
importantly, we wanted to know <q>are our customers happy?</q>
Enter, [NPS]({% link _researching/what-is-nps.md %})

## How did CustomerSure Help?
CustomerSure provides us with clear visibility into our NPS, and importantly for
us, provides good-looking, customisable, branded surveys. Getting set up was
completely __plug and play__, which was important as we’re not a technical team.

We now have quick and accurate insights on what to improve upon and when to act.
Having our metrics laid out so nicely keeps us up to snuff. If we notice a dip
in the numbers, we can quickly jump to the feedback to hone in on issues and
work toward solutions.

> Fast, articulate answers to our questions any time, and every time we’re
> scratching our heads. __You guys are the best!__

## What results have you achieved?
Countless happy, return customers who are impressed and hungry for more
interaction once they realise a team of real people are reading their feedback
and replying.  It should be standard but unfortunately, not many companies out
there reply to feedback they receive.

> We understand the importance and value in reading, understanding and in
> almost every case, replying.

By listening to the feedback, we’ve made several improvements to our
subscription program and, rolled out a rewards program that is home to almost
150K users! Up until the [Smile.io](https://www.smile.io/) roll out,
we hadn’t ever had a rewards program. But it wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for
the clear feedback we collected asking for this feature. Circling back, thanks
CustomerSure!

## Has there been anything memorable in the feedback you’ve received?
When you’re serving up the world’s strongest coffee, you have the world’s most
caffeinated customer base. Often times, after what I imagine to be a couple cups
deep, we’ll get brilliant poems or short stories about what our coffee did
to/for them. Sometimes it’s a haiku about just the brewing process of Death
Wish Coffee.

Every now and then, if one truly stands out, I’ll make it a point to email it
around to the team as a friendly reminder of the importance of what we do here.

> It also really boosts team morale, and serves as an important reminder to the
> team about __WHY__ we do it, not just __WHAT__ we do. That means the world to us.

## What would be your advice to somebody who’s about to start on customer feedback?
Have a tone of voice guide in place, prior to creating your feedback survey.
Having a defined __on-brand__ tone is key to making sure you’re asking the
right questions and more importantly, asking them the right way. We see a
response rate of over 20% to our surveys, which we’re pleased with.

Also, make sure you’re asking questions that you can use to make improvements
within your company. Give the questions purpose. Be sure to leave blank space
for their written feedback. This blank space is invaluable.

Lastly, make sure that your team is equipped to be able to reply to the feedback
you’re collecting in a timely fashion. If you’re not reading it to understand or
reply to it, it’s just taking up space and time for your business.
