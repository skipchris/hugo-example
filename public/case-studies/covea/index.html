<ul>
<li><strong>Company</strong> <a href="https://www.coveainsurance.co.uk/">Covéa Insurance</a></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> Halifax, UK</li>
</ul>
<p>Covéa Insurance Plc is the UK underwriting business of leading French mutual
insurance group Covéa.</p>
<p>One of the <strong>top 75 employers</strong> in West Yorkshire and Humber, and the winner
of multiple industry awards, they have a longstanding commitment to an
effective Voice of the Customer programme.</p>
<p>They knew that to improve further, they needed a more flexible software platform,
and a trusted partner to help with implementation.</p>
<p>We interviewed Tom Hepworth, Research &amp; Insight Manager.</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-covéa">Tell us about Covéa.</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/covea/office1.webp" alt="Covéa office">{:class=&lsquo;longform-pull-right&rsquo;}</p>
<p>Covéa Insurance has a strong people and service ethos and holds <strong>ServiceMark
accreditation</strong> with Distinction for its Personal Lines operation and its
Commercial &amp; HNW Claims teams, as well as Chartered Insurer status for its
Commercial business.</p>
<p>Covéa is signatory to the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter and the
Insurance Inclusivity Pledge. In 2022 they were named <strong>Insurer of the Year</strong>
at the British Claims Awards and Personal Lines Insurer of the Year at the Insurance Times Awards.</p>
<h2 id="what-challenges-were-you-facing">What challenges were you facing?</h2>
<p>Getting insight from our customers and broker partners is invaluable to us as a
business, but we wanted to ensure we were doing so in the most <strong>engaging and
efficient way</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we had rapidly grown our Voice of Customer programme
but due to varying system constraints, it was becoming increasingly
inefficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We needed the ability to be agile and drive our programme in real time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-did-customersure-help">How did CustomerSure help?</h2>
<p>We were looking for a provider that would enable us to be both proactive and
reactive in collecting feedback. CustomerSure gives us that.</p>
<p>[Their platform]({% link product/index.html %}) allows us to build, launch and amend surveys in
real-time. This has proven priceless on several occasions, letting us create
quick, targeted surveys focussed on specific elements of the customer journey.</p>
<p>By doing this, we get fast, reliable feedback on what delights and frustrates
our customers and broker partners at different points.</p>
<h2 id="what-results-have-you-achieved">What results have you achieved?</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/covea/office2.webp" alt="Covéa office photo">{:class=&lsquo;longform-pull-left&rsquo;}{:style=&lsquo;width: 30%&rsquo;}</p>
<p>Using the CustomerSure platform and [working with their great team]({% link working-together/index.html %}),
we have been able to enhance our Voice of Customer programme substantially.</p>
<p>The <strong>agile nature of the tool</strong> has led to us regularly reviewing our question-sets
whilst monitoring newer areas of our journeys. A key driver of this has been to
ensure we are providing good outcomes to our customers across all touchpoints.</p>
<p>We’ve also not been afraid to trial new approaches or questions to understand
what additional insight they can provide. In most cases this has added true
value to the business — in a couple it hasn’t, however that’s the capability of
the tool — allowing you to try, fail fast and make improvements.</p>
<p>Another focus for us was to increase our survey and response rates and the tool
has allowed us to do that by conducting A|B testing with invitation messaging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen really strong increases on response rates as a result.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="has-there-been-anything-memorable-in-the-feedback-youve-received">Has there been anything memorable in the feedback you’ve received?</h2>
<p>The standout for us as a company, is the volume of feedback we receive
highlighting the phenomenal service colleagues interacting with customers
provide. We’re so proud of this, we regularly
[share feedback across our teams]({% link _implementing/team-motivation.md %})
so everyone is aware of what we do.</p>
<p>Verbatim feedback has also been a fantastic tool for internal recognition – We
make sure to feedback to colleagues where a customer has mentioned them by
name, so they know their efforts make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-advice-to-somebody-whos-about-to-start-a-voice-of-the-customer-project">What would be your advice to somebody who’s about to start a Voice of the Customer project?</h2>
<p>Don’t get bogged down by a specific [metric]({% link _researching/customer-satisfaction-metrics.md %})
or a target you’ve been set. Explore what your customers are telling you and
embrace that feedback – positive or negative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments from customers are real and genuine; they expect to be listened to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking the [right questions]({% link _implementing/what-questions-voc-survey.md %})
and in the right format is key. Ask questions where feedback can make a difference
within your business; and make sure your colleagues are prepared and equipped to
take that feedback on board; and drive actions from it.</p>
<p>Finally, find a voice of customer partner who reflects the values you have, and
can support your way of working. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We feel we have found that in CustomerSure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
