<p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href="https://www.kkwindsolutions.com/" title="KK Wind Solutions website">KK Wind Solutions</a></p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> KK Wind Solutions is headquartered in Denmark and operates in eight countries across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/kk-wind/kenneth-damm-hansen.webp" alt="Kenneth Damm Hansen">{:class=&ldquo;longform-pull-right&rdquo;}</p>
<p>Kenneth Damm Hansen is Director – Marketing &amp; Communication. We asked Kenneth to describe his experience of choosing and implementing CustomerSure as the customer experience platform for KK Wind.</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-kk-wind-solutions">Tell us about KK Wind Solutions</h2>
<p>Building on more than 40 years of experience, KK Wind Solutions is a strong partner in electro-mechanical systems for wind turbines. Our capabilities span development of state-of-the-art technologies, high-quality lean manufacturing, flexible aftermarket solutions and advanced monitoring services.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-your-requirements">What were your requirements?</h2>
<p>Our industry and business is characterised by having a few big wind OEM customers, submitting large orders and long-term partnerships. Hence the importance of delivering a good customer experience is obvious.</p>
<p>Even though we form strong partnerships with our customers, we know that we need to continue to exceed their expectations through ease of work, innovative solutions and deliver on our promises.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/kk-wind-factory.jpg" alt="">{:class=&ldquo;img-fluid&rdquo;}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that we are no better than our last customer experience, and having few customers that are all irreplaceable, we went looking for a new powerful CX platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/uploads/kk-turbines-forest.jpg" alt="">{:class=&ldquo;img-fluid&rdquo;}</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-choose-your-cx-platform-and-how-was-the-implementation">How did you choose your CX platform and how was the implementation?</h2>
<p>When looking for our new CX platform, we consulted a third-party vendor to shortlist the entire market for CX platforms, based on our requirements.</p>
<p>After a few meetings and benchmarking with other suppliers, CustomerSure proved to be the best match for us, providing a simple but effective survey tool, which could also support multiple metrics like NPS and CSAT.</p>
<p>Also pricing was fair and implementation was rather fast and a very personalised experience from Guy and Luke.</p>
<p>They really listened to our needs and tailored the platform accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/cad-diagram.png" alt="">{:class=&ldquo;img-fluid&rdquo;}</p>
<h2 id="what-results-have-you-achieved">What results have you achieved?</h2>
<p>After working in the platform for a few years, we are still happy about the solution. It’s easy to use, especially for people who do not work in the platform on a daily basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows us to collect data, respond to customer needs and continuously develop our company with the customer at heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/uploads/electrical-board.jpg" alt="">{:class=&ldquo;img-fluid&rdquo;}</p>
<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-based-on-your-experience">What advice would you give, based on your experience?</h2>
<p>Keep it simple for the customer – remember that it’s also a customer experience to fill out a survey on customer experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it should be short and quite effortless for a customer to submit responses and provide their feedback.</p>
