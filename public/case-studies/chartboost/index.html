<ul>
<li><strong>Company</strong> <a href="https://www.chartboost.com/">Chartboost</a></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> San Francisco, US</li>
</ul>
<p>Chartboost is a technology company based in San Francisco and their fun loving
culture is evident in the playful design of their offices.</p>
<p>Although their work is about fun &amp; games they&rsquo;re deadly serious about
customer service.</p>
<p>They were already working hard on service, but they felt they could strengthen
their business by doing even better, and they wanted to benefit from having
customer feedback integrated into their processes.</p>
<p>We interviewed Manager of Support Operations, Dave Sheehan.</p>

<h2 id="tell-us-about-chartboost">Tell us about Chartboost</h2>
<p>Chartboost is the leading global mobile game advertising platform. We help game
developers build a business through facilitating monetization, user acquisition
and promotion.</p>
<p>We work hard and play hard, our business is after all, games!</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a fair play and transparent advertiser. Part of that
is providing outstanding service to all of our developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted evidence to assure developers that we had outstanding support service.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-challenges-were-you-facing">What challenges were you facing?</h2>
<p>We knew we were doing good things based on anecdotal feedback but we suspected
there were ways that we could really improve.</p>
<p>We also wanted evidence in the form of solid numbers and facts that our
business team could use to assure developers that we had outstanding support
service.</p>
<p>We looked hard at the market offering customer feedback solutions. We liked
CustomerSure because it was customizable, allowed for more than thumbs up/thumbs
down or happy/sad face feedback, and which integrated easily into our Zendesk
automation.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-customersure-help">How did CustomerSure help?</h2>
<p>Getting CustomerSure going was fast and easy.</p>
<p>It only took a little bit of development work with the CustomerSure API to get
the full automation we wanted.</p>
<p>We definitely exceeded our own expectations in terms of quality and usefulness
of response, response rate and easy management.</p>
<p>We are expanding our CSAT survey effort to include Japanese, Russian and Chinese
in the near future.</p>
<p>Through all of this Guy and the team at CustomerSure have been super responsive
and helpful, providing answers and assisting in a timely and highly professional
manner. We are an elite team and like working with other elite teams!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Our customer focus has increased job satisfaction for our team, made the

<h2 id="has-there-been-anything-funny-or-surprising-in-the-feedback-youve-received">Has there been anything funny or surprising in the feedback you&rsquo;ve received?</h2>
<p>Customers have made numerous suggestions about increasing the compensation of
our team members and they even suggested we should clone one of our team-mates.</p>
