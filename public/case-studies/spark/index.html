  <h1>longform content.html: How Spark Energy improve their CX [Case Study]</h1>
  <p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/spark/logo.png" alt="Spark Logo"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company:</strong> <a href="https://sparkenergy.co.uk/">Spark Energy</a></li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong>  Selkirk, Scotland</li>
</ul>
<p>Spark Energy, are an exciting challenger brand in the UK’s energy sector.
They’ve supplied energy to over 350,000 people across the country, and continue
to grow, now as part of the OVO Energy family, thanks to their focus on service
and simplicity.</p>
<p>Because energy is a competitive market, with razor-thin profit margins, Spark
<strong>need</strong> to be better at service than their competition to retain their
customers, and build a steady stream of recommendations.</p>
<p>We spoke to Meg Darling, Head of Customer Service.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/spark/spark1.jpg" alt="The Spark team">{:class=&lsquo;longform-content-image&rsquo;}</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-spark">Tell us about Spark…</h2>
<p>When you sell a commodity like energy, it’s important to find ways to
differentiate yourself in a competitive environment, and the way that we do
that is through our people.</p>
<p>You can’t expect great customer service from a team that doesn’t feel
supported, so we go out of our way to provide that support. We try to create
an environment where our people know that we care for them, where people know
they’ll be listened to, and where people who want to grow and develop in their
roles get the opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>We’re a vibrant company. Change is inevitable, so we try and keep ahead of
change, by continually improving our systems, and continually investing in the
skills of our people</p>
<p>And really importantly to us, as a major employer, we’re a huge part of the
community here in the Scottish Borders. Families trust us to treat them with
respect, and that’s a responsibility we take seriously.</p>
<h2 id="what-drove-you-to-look-for-a-customer-feedback-platform">What drove you to look for a customer feedback platform?</h2>
<p>We knew that to grow as a business we needed to not only measure, but improve
satisfaction… And we knew that
the easiest way to improve satisfaction is listening to customer feedback.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-was-important-to-you-when-you-chose-a-supplier">And what was important to you when you chose a supplier?</h2>
<p>We needed some key features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Different customers have different needs so it was vital
that we could segment scores and insights across our diverse customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: We needed control over how our feedback surveys look, work,
and what questions they ask.</li>
<li><strong>Advisor-friendly</strong>: We employ great advisors who are keen to engage directly
with customer feedback to help with their personal development, so it was really
important that we chose a platform that supported this, and was easy to use,
to avoid lengthy training.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to use. It’s great that our agents engage with CustomerSure so well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-has-customersure-helped-you-achieve-your-business-goals">How has CustomerSure helped you achieve your business goals?</h2>
<p>Key for us was that we <strong>improved the quality</strong> and <strong>decreased the cost</strong> of our
customer service, and we’ve seen success in both those areas.</p>
<p>By using CustomerSure to identify ‘pinch points’, we’ve improved First Call
Resolution, reduced duplicate calls, and measurably improved customer
satisfaction.</p>
<p>We discover which touchpoints in our customer journeys have problems, leading to
people calling us multiple times to fix an issue, and tackle the root causes of
those problems</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/spark/spark2.jpg" alt="The Spark team">{:class=&lsquo;longform-content-image&rsquo;}</p>
<p>But in addition, we can easily spot customers who are losing patience with us,
and intervene early, often by proactively calling them to talk issues through
and come to a resolution. We call back up to 30% of our negative feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach has lead to a reduction in complaint volume!!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-changes-have-you-seen-since-you-increased-your-customer-focus">What changes have you seen since you increased your customer focus?</h2>
<p>We’ve seen a reduction in call volume, which has naturally reduced our cost of
service</p>
<p>One unexpected benefit is it’s simplified and improved the conversations we have
around the value of satisfaction to our bottom line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I have continuous real-time satisfaction data, I can have more meaningful
conversations with our business about what, exactly, a budget decrease or
increase would mean to customer satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CustomerSure has helped make our culture more customer-centric. Agents love
working with the feedback, and want to know their numbers. Discussing verbatim
customer comments has been a really impressive way of improving our teams’
all-important “soft skills”.</p>

<h2 id="anything-funny-in-the-feedback-youve-received">Anything funny in the feedback you’ve received?</h2>
<p>We did have a lady who worked for a competitor write something along the lines of
<em>“I know you won’t respond to this, because at XXXX, we don’t even bother to
read customer comments”</em></p>
<p>…I called her back.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-advice-to-someone-getting-started-with-real-time-customer-feedback">What would be your advice to someone getting started with real-time customer feedback?</h2>
<p>You get out what you put in.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get paralysed by insight, but not know how to act on it, which is
why we have a full-time employee responsible for customer experience improvement.
Don’t expect it to run itself.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s important to review things regularly. Your business
changes, your customers’ expectations change, so it’s important to make sure
your experience improvement programme keeps pace.</p>
