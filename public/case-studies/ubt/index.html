<li><strong>Company</strong>: <a href="http://www.universalbusinessteam.com">UBT</a></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: International presence in 19 countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>UBT is a business membership group that helps its member companies to prosper
through advice, training and collective purchasing power. Customer satisfaction
lies at the heart of everything they do.</p>
<p>An important aspect of UBT culture is contributing to charities and supporting
the local community.</p>
<p>We interviewed Bob Calder, Customer Service Team Leader.</p>

<h2 id="tell-us-about-ubt">Tell us about UBT</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the business advisory industry. We give small to medium sized
businesses the same negotiating muscle as a large corporation through group
buying.</p>
<p>The culture at UBT is very charismatic and the team spirit is evident in every
internal transaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We needed a simple system to capture data from our clients that was easy to
use and easy to report from.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-do-your-customers-choose-ubt">Why do your customers choose UBT?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re particularly strong at delivering cutting edge training for every aspect
of business ranging from sales to digital marketing and computer skills.</p>
<p>We also provide a one stop shop for a large variety of products and services
that enable businesses to trade competitively.</p>

<h2 id="what-challenges-were-you-facing">What challenges were you facing?</h2>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have an understanding of how our customers viewed us because we didn&rsquo;t
have a simple system to report feedback.</p>
<p>We needed a simple system to capture data from our clients that was easy to use
and easy to report from.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-customersure-help">How did CustomerSure help?</h2>
<p>CustomerSure had an understanding of our needs and were prepared to discuss
our proposition even though we are a very unique corporation.</p>
<p>It only took us 6 days to get fully up and runningâ€¦this was faster
than we expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clients feel listened to, which results in happy customers and increased spend.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-results-have-you-achieved">What results have you achieved?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re thrilled to have tripled our Net Promoter Score. Because customers are
continually giving us feedback and scores we&rsquo;ve managed to increase our NPS
dramatically from 23 to 69.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/ubt/ubt2.jpg" alt="UBT - Customer Service">{:class=&lsquo;longform-content-image&rsquo;}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about the score. More importantly, clients feel
listened to, which results in happy customers and increased spend.</p>
