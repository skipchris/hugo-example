<ul>
<li><strong>Company</strong> <a href="https://www.act.com/">Swiftpage</a></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> Newcastle, UK, and Scottsdale, AZ</li>
</ul>
<p>Swiftpage is the brand behind Act! – the best-selling Contact &amp; Customer
Manager. It&rsquo;s a fun loving, fast-moving, &lsquo;can do&rsquo; culture with people at the
core – the people who deliver service and the customers who receive it.</p>
<p>Faced with the challenge of delivering high quality software and exceptional
service to customers around the world, they knew that improving customer
satisfaction would drive up contract renewals.</p>
<p>We interviewed Lindsay Boullin, VP, Global Operations.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/swiftpage/swiftpage1.jpg" alt="Swiftpage office locations">{:class=&lsquo;longform-content-image&rsquo;}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By using our sales and contact management database software, and email marketing
web tools they can better interact with their customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really good at ensuring our products and services are easy to get results
from, and are very affordable to use.</p>
<p>We have a great culture – we have a great bunch of people who have fun while
they constantly try to delight our customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was important to us that we had reliable, daily survey data coming through.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-made-you-look-for-a-customer-feedback-system">What made you look for a customer feedback system?</h2>
<p>Customer feedback is a key measure for us to know how well we, and our service
providers, are delivering service to our customers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s key because experience tells us that happy customers renew their contracts
and that renewals revenue can then go into the investments we need to make into
our people, products and services.</p>
<p>It was important to us that we had reliable, daily survey data coming through.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-customersure-help">How did CustomerSure help?</h2>
<p>We chose CustomerSure because of the trusting relationship we were able to
build with their team.</p>
<p>We were previously a part of Sage. The CustomerSure solution allowed us to take
the same approach that worked for us there, but with a fraction of the resources.</p>
<p>Getting up and running was simple and much quicker than expected – we just
had to make sure we involved the right people from our side.</p>
<p>We use CustomerSure to generate our monthly reports which are used across the
business to measure how well our support organisation is doing.</p>
<p>We love the instantaneous results our reps get and use the individual feedback
to award monthly prizes which they can exchange for vouchers and other incentives.</p>
<p>Simple and effective sums it up!</p>

<h2 id="what-results-have-you-achieved">What results have you achieved?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always had a focus on customers, but CustomerSure has helped us get a
consistent view. This has been so successful that we have decided to use
CustomerSure to measure satisfaction around the world.</p>
<p>We are achieving 95%+ CSAT in Europe and we look forward to using future
feedback to help identify areas for improvement in service delivery in the US as
well as in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-memorable-or-surprising-about-the-feedback-youve-received">Is there anything memorable or surprising about the feedback you&rsquo;ve received?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic to read the praise that our hard working front line team gets.
Sometimes the criticism is hard to read, but it does give tangible pointers for
where product and service improvements are needed.</p>
<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-someone-about-customer-feedback">What advice would you give someone about customer feedback?</h2>
<p>Put in place a process to ensure you take action based on the feedback you will
get and get back to the survey respondent as soon as possible to tell them what
you&rsquo;ve done with their feedback.</p>
